       "(['A 43-year-old male presents to a travel clinic with a 3-day history of recurrent high fever, headache, and diarrhea. He returned one week ago from a 5-week trip to Mozambique and Chile. He did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis. Social history is significant for swimming in a freshwater lake near Maputo. On physical examination, he is febrile (39.2°C) but hemodynamic parameters are stable. There is no rash, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory evaluation reveals a normal total white blood cell count but significant eosinophilia (2.1 x 10^9/L). Liver transaminases (ALT 179 U/L, AST 106 U/L) and CRP are elevated. A chest radiograph demonstrates multiple small, nodular lesions in the periphery of the lower lung zones bilaterally. Thick and thin smears for malaria are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?'],\n",
       " ['Acute Schistosomiasis (Katayama Syndrome)'],\n",
       " [\"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a specific high-risk exposure: swimming in freshwater in a Schistosoma-endemic region (Mozambique). 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of acute fever combined with marked eosinophilia and pulmonary micronodules (representing a hypersensitivity pneumonitis to migrating schistosomula) is the classic triad for Katayama syndrome. 3. Differential Exclusion: Malaria is a critical 'can't miss' diagnosis in a febrile traveler from Mozambique, but it typically presents with thrombocytopenia and anemia rather than the significant eosinophilia seen here. Typhoid fever is a differential for fever and abdominal symptoms but is usually associated with eosinopenia (disappearance of eosinophils). 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is often clinical in the acute phase due to a window period where eggs are not yet shed; it is later confirmed by seroconversion or the detection of Schistosoma mansoni ova in stool samples once the worms mature.\"])"

Diagnosis: The most likely diagnosis is Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma mansoni).

Differential Exclusion: Malaria is a critical 'can't miss' diagnosis in a febrile traveler from Mozambique, but it typically presents with thrombocytopenia and anemia rather than the significant eosinophilia seen here. Typhoid fever is a differential for fever and abdominal symptoms but is usually associated with eosinopenia (disappearance of eosinophils). 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is often clinical in the acute phase due to a window period where eggs are not yet shed; it is later confirmed by seroconversion or the detection of Schistosoma mansoni ova in stool samples once the worms mature.\"}]"
