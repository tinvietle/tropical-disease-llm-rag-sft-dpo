45,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10397454/,"A 48-year-old male from Papua, Indonesia, presents to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of high-grade fever (41°C), severe chills, and inability to sit or stand unaided (prostration). His medical history is significant for a splenectomy performed two months prior for massive splenomegaly. Vital signs reveal tachycardia (120 bpm) and significant hypotension (80/50 mmHg). Physical examination is negative for pallor or hepatomegaly. Laboratory evaluation shows a creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL and elevated cell-free hemoglobin, but normal platelet and white blood cell counts. A peripheral blood smear demonstrates numerous intraerythrocytic parasites (predominantly trophozoites) alongside erythrocytes containing nuclear remnants (Howell-Jolly bodies). Rapid diagnostic testing is positive for pan-pLDH but negative for HRP2. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Severe Plasmodium vivax Malaria,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in a malaria-endemic region (Papua, Indonesia) and has a critical risk factor: recent splenectomy (asplenia). The lack of splenic filtration allows for higher parasite biomass and intravascular hemolysis. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of *Plasmodium vivax* (identified by morphology and pan-pLDH positivity without HRP2) manifesting with 'severe' criteria (hypotension/shock, prostration, AKI) is the anchor. Severe disease is less common in *P. vivax* than *P. falciparum* but is strongly associated with the asplenic state. 3. Differential Exclusion: Post-splenectomy Sepsis (e.g., *Streptococcus pneumoniae*) is the most urgent differential given the hypotension and fever in an asplenic patient; however, the presence of malaria parasites on smear and the specific negative bacterial workup (implied by recovery on antimalarials alone) point to malaria as the primary cause. *P. falciparum* is excluded by the negative HRP2 test and smear morphology. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of *P. vivax* on microscopy in the context of severe physiological decompensation (shock), a known complication of vivax malaria in the absence of splenic function.",`10,10,5
1,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4608352/,"A 50-year-old male physician is medically evacuated to a high-level isolation unit after developing a febrile illness while working in Sierra Leone. His initial clinical course is dominated by severe gastrointestinal symptoms requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation. However, days after admission, his condition deteriorates significantly with the onset of profound hypoxia and respiratory failure, necessitating advanced airway management and mechanical ventilation. Chest imaging reveals diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Diagnostic bronchoscopy is performed, and molecular testing of the bronchial aspirate reveals an extremely high viral load. Concurrently, laboratory testing identifies a parasitic co-infection. He is treated with experimental antiviral therapies and supportive care, eventually achieving full recovery. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ebola Virus Disease (complicated by Ebola Interstitial Pneumonia),"1. Epidemiology: The patient is a healthcare worker returning from Sierra Leone, a high-risk demographic for acquiring viral hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). 2. Clinical Anchor: While EVD typically manifests with gastrointestinal and hemorrhagic symptoms, this case is anchored by the rare development of primary respiratory failure. The pathognomonic finding is the detection of high viral load in the lung fluid (bronchial aspirate), confirming direct viral invasion of the lung parenchyma (Viral Interstitial Pneumonia), rather than just secondary ARDS or bacterial superinfection. 3. Differential Exclusion: The patient has a confirmed co-infection with Plasmodium vivax (Malaria). While severe malaria can cause respiratory distress (ARDS), the specific finding of high viral RNA in the lung fluid confirms that the respiratory failure was primarily driven by the viral pneumonitis, not the parasite. 4. Confirmation: The isolation of the virus from the respiratory tract confirms the diagnosis of EVD-associated interstitial pneumonia.",10,10,5
2,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7888312/,"A 25-year-old male motorcycle taxi driver in the Democratic Republic of the Congo presents with a severe, acute febrile illness characterized by nausea, vomiting, and asthenia. His medical history is notable for a confirmed episode of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) six months prior, for which he was treated with monoclonal antibodies (mAb114) and discharged after consecutive negative blood PCR tests. He also received the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine 12 months ago. Following his initial discharge, a semen sample tested negative for viral RNA. On this current presentation, his condition rapidly deteriorates, leading to death. Post-mortem blood testing is positive for Ebola Virus RNA. Genomic sequencing of the virus from this fatal episode reveals that the viral strain has evolved at a rate four-fold slower than the concurrent outbreak strain circulating in the community. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ebola Virus Disease (Relapse),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a known survivor of Ebola Virus Disease in an endemic region. While survivors typically have immunity, this case highlights the rare risk of viral persistence. 2. Clinical Anchor: The core clinical puzzle is the recurrence of active viremia and fatal disease in a patient who was previously vaccinated, treated, and declared 'cured' (serocleared). 3. Differential Exclusion: The primary differential is 'Reinfection' (exposure to a new case in the community). However, this is explicitly ruled out by the genomic data: if it were a reinfection, the virus would match the genetic drift of the currently circulating strains. The 'slower evolutionary rate' indicates the virus was dormant within the host (reduced replication pressure) rather than transmitting through the population. 4. Confirmation: The phylogenetic analysis confirming the virus is a direct descendant of his original infection, with minimal mutations, confirms a diagnosis of EVD Relapse (recrudescence) from a persistent anatomical reservoir.",10,10,5
3,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6580501/,"A 22-year-old female, gravida 6 para 4, at 34 weeks of gestation presents to a general hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She reports a 2-day history of acute onset fever, vomiting, and general malaise. She denies any bleeding diathesis. On admission, she is febrile (38.5°C) but hemodynamically stable. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing confirms a viral infection, and she is transferred to a specialized treatment center. She is managed with oral rehydration, antibiotics, and antipyretics. Remarkably, her symptoms resolve completely within one week, and she is discharged with a viable pregnancy. Four weeks later, at 38 weeks gestation, she returns in spontaneous labor and delivers a live-born female infant. Umbilical cord blood and neonatal swabs are collected for testing. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ebola Virus Disease (Maternal Survival with Healthy Neonate),"1. Epidemiology: The patient presents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during an active outbreak, a primary risk factor for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of acute fever and gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting) in a pregnant woman in this region requires ruling out EVD. 3. The Clinical Paradox: Historically, EVD in pregnancy is associated with extremely high rates of spontaneous abortion and neonatal mortality (>90%) due to high viral replication in the placenta. However, this case represents the rare exception (often termed a 'miracle baby'). 4. Confirmation: The maternal PCR confirmation anchors the diagnosis. The analytic takeaway is that maternal survival with a healthy, EBOV-negative neonate is possible if the maternal disease phenotype is mild and the viral load is insufficient to breach the placental barrier, preventing vertical transmission.",10,4,4

He reports a 2-day history of fatigue and a documented oral temperature of 100.3°F (37.9°C). He recently returned to the United States nine days prior, after completing a rotation treating patients during a viral epidemic in Guinea. He strictly adhered to personal protective equipment protocols during his deployment. Review of systems is negative for vomiting, diarrhea, cough, myalgia, or abnormal bleeding. He is immediately placed in isolation for evaluation. Initial blood work is sent for nucleic acid amplification testing. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ebola Virus Disease,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a humanitarian aid worker returning from Guinea, a region with active transmission, which is the single most important risk factor. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation represents the early 'dry phase' of the disease (fever and profound fatigue) appearing within the classic incubation period (8-10 days post-exposure), even in the absence of the 'wet' gastrointestinal symptoms that typically develop later. 3. Differential Exclusion: Malaria is the most common cause of fever in travelers returning from West Africa and must be ruled out; however, the specific history of direct care for patients with hemorrhagic fever places this diagnosis at the top of the differential. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of viral RNA via PCR in the blood, despite the mild initial clinical presentation.",10,10,5
6,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11374124/,"A 25-year-old female presents with a 1-month history of a generalized skin eruption characterized by thick, gray, crusty keratotic scales covering the majority of her body. She reports that the lesions are only mildly pruritic, with some worsening at night. Her medical history is significant for severe malnutrition and advanced autoimmune disease, rendering her immunocompromised. Family members living in the same household deny similar symptoms. On physical examination, the skin shows diffuse grayish hyperkeratosis. Microscopic examination of skin scrapings prepared with potassium hydroxide reveals a high burden of mites and eggs. Despite the initiation of therapy, the patient's clinical course is complicated by secondary bacterial infection and sepsis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Crusted Scabies (Norwegian Scabies),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient's immunocompromised and malnourished state is the primary precipitating factor. In immunocompetent hosts, the immune system limits the mite population; in immunocompromised hosts, this control mechanism fails, allowing the mites to proliferate into the millions. 2. Clinical Anchor: The description of 'thick, gray, crusty keratotic scales' is pathognomonic for Crusted Scabies. The specific grayish color is a strong clinical clue mentioned in the report.  3. Differential Exclusion: The patient reports only mild itching (the 'Pruritus Paradox'). This is a crucial discriminator; classic scabies is intensely pruritic due to hypersensitivity. In Crusted Scabies, the immune response—and thus the itch—is blunted. 4. Confirmation: The KOH prep showing numerous mites and eggs confirms the infestation, distinguishing it from psoriasis or other exfoliative dermatitides.",10,10,5

He reports that the lesions are only mildly pruritic. His medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and he has received multiple intramuscular injections of dexamethasone from a general practitioner for the management of itching. On physical examination, extensive thick crusts are noted. Laboratory evaluation reveals uncontrolled hyperglycemia with a random blood sugar of 498 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 10.1%. Microscopic examination of skin scrapings from the lesions reveals numerous mites, eggs, and scybala. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Crusted Scabies (Norwegian Scabies),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has two major risk factors for immunosuppression: uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 10.1%) and iatrogenic immunosuppression from repeated corticosteroid (dexamethasone) injections. This compromised immune state allows for the uncontrolled proliferation of mites. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of 'hyperkeratotic crusted plaques' rather than the typical inflammatory papules of scabies is the key visual anchor. The paradoxical mildness of the itch (despite the massive infestation) is a classic feature of the crusted variant, resulting from the blunted immune response. 3. Differential Exclusion: Psoriasis is a common differential for hyperkeratotic plaques (psoriasiform); however, the presence of mites on scraping and the context of immunosuppression rule out a primary inflammatory dermatosis. 4. Confirmation: The direct visualization of numerous Sarcoptes scabiei mites, eggs, and fecal pellets (scybala) on microscopy confirms the diagnosis.",10,10,5

Her medical history is significant for a 30-year history of untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus. Notably, she reports self-medicating with topical corticosteroids for seven weeks to treat pruritus prior to presentation. Physical examination reveals a cachectic woman (BMI 16.4 kg/m²) with widespread, psoriasiform, yellowish-brown hyperkeratotic plaques. These lesions are fissured and firm, predominantly affecting the dorsal hands and feet, but also involving the elbows, anterior neck, and posterior thorax. The plaques are tender on palpation. A skin scraping (Muller's test) is performed on the hand lesions using mineral oil. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Crusted Scabies (Norwegian Scabies),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has multiple risk factors for severe infestation: untreated diabetes, malnutrition (low BMI), and most importantly, the inappropriate long-term use of topical corticosteroids. Steroids suppress the local immune response and itch sensation, allowing uncontrolled mite proliferation. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presence of thick, fissured, yellowish-brown hyperkeratotic plaques (psoriasiform appearance) on the hands and feet is the visual hallmark of Crusted Scabies. 3. Differential Exclusion: Psoriasis is a visual differential due to the thick plaques; however, the rapid evolution (1 month) and the context of steroid misuse favor an infectious etiology. 4. Confirmation: The Muller's test (skin scraping) revealing an ovoid body with four pairs of short legs confirms the presence of Sarcoptes scabiei.",10,10,5

She appears uncomfortable and exhibits signs of intense pruritus. Dermatoscopy of the lesions reveals multiple dense triangular structures. Several family members and residents at her care facility report developing itchy rashes recently. A skin biopsy and scraping are performed. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Crusted Scabies (Norwegian Scabies),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient represents the classic demographic for this condition: elderly, bedridden, and cognitively impaired (dementia). These factors prevent effective scratching and self-care, allowing for unchecked mite proliferation. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presence of extensive 'grey-yellowish hyperkeratotic plaques' on the palms and face is pathognomonic. The dermatoscopic finding of the 'delta wing jet sign' (dense triangles) corresponds to the head parts of the mite. 3. Differential Exclusion: While the hyperkeratosis might suggest psoriasis or eczema, the contagious nature of the condition (affecting relatives and other residents) definitively rules out non-infectious dermatoses. 4.

","A 23-year-old female presents to the outpatient department with a 1-year history of persistent, dull lower back pain that has begun to inhibit her activities of daily living. She resides in a rural village near the border of Southern Angola. Over the past 6 months, she reports unintentional weight loss, night sweats, and loss of appetite, but denies any cough, trauma, or family history of malignancy. She also notes a growing deformity in her lumbar region. Physical examination reveals tenderness over the lower back and sacrum with a palpable structural kyphosis (gibbus deformity) in the lumbar spine. Neurological assessment shows mild lower extremity weakness but preserved rectal sphincter tone and a normal gait. Laboratory results indicate a non-reactive HIV test, normal complete blood count, and normal renal function; however, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is markedly elevated at 130 mm/hour. A chest radiograph shows no evidence of pulmonary disease, and sputum nucleic acid amplification testing is negative. Spine imaging is obtained. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pott's Disease (Tuberculous Spondylitis),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from a high-prevalence region (Southern Angola) presenting with chronic back pain and classic B-symptoms (weight loss, night sweats). This clinical picture is highly suggestive of a chronic infectious or malignant process. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presence of a gibbus deformity is a hallmark sign of spinal tuberculosis. It results from the destruction and collapse of the anterior vertebral body, leading to acute kyphotic angulation. 3. Differential Exclusion: While malignancy (metastasis or primary bone tumor) is a consideration, the patient's young age (23) and the markedly elevated ESR (130 mm/hr) in an endemic setting strongly favor an infectious etiology. Pyogenic osteomyelitis is usually more acute and febrile. 4. Confirmation: Although pulmonary tests were negative, the clinical triad of gibbus deformity, constitutional symptoms, and high inflammatory markers in an endemic area is sufficient for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (Pott's disease).",10,10,5

MRI of the thoracolumbar spine reveals a destructive lesion involving the T12 and L1 vertebral bodies with vertebral collapse and pathological fracture, resulting in significant kyphotic deformity. T2-weighted imaging demonstrates a hyperintense mass extending into the paraspinal and retro-spinal spaces, forming large fluid collections consistent with abscesses. CT imaging confirms the destruction of the vertebral bodies. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Spinal Tuberculosis (Pott's Disease),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young adult from an endemic region (Indonesia), which is a key demographic for extrapulmonary tuberculosis. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of vertebral destruction (spondylodiscitis) spanning multiple levels (T12-L1), significant kyphotic deformity (gibbus), and the presence of 'cold abscesses' (paraspinal/retro-spinal fluid collections) is pathognomonic. 3. Differential Exclusion: Pyogenic osteomyelitis typically presents more acutely with fever and lacks the massive 'cold' abscess formation and severe kyphosis seen here. Metastatic disease is less likely given the patient's young age and the specific abscess formation. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is supported by the radiologic pattern of destruction and the clinical context, necessitating surgical debridement and stabilization alongside anti-tuberculous chemotherapy.",10,10,5

He states that his symptoms initially improved yesterday but returned today with greater intensity, accompanied by abdominal pain, repeated vomiting of dark material, and bleeding from his gums. He has no documentation of prior immunizations and reports that he works daily in fields near the forest edge. On physical examination, he appears toxic and jaundiced. His heart rate is 58 beats per minute despite a temperature of 39.5°C. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Yellow Fever,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient represents the highest-risk demographic identified in the study: a male aged >15 years working in an agrarian community in Oyo State, Nigeria, where resurgence and outbreaks have been documented (2019-2020). His occupation as a farmer exposes him to the sylvatic/intermediate cycle vectors (Aedes spp.) prevalent in forest fringes. 2. Clinical Anchor: The classic presentation of a 'biphasic' illness (fever-remission-toxic recurrence) combined with jaundice, hemorrhagic signs (hematemesis), and Faget’s sign (bradycardia in the presence of fever) anchors the diagnosis of Yellow Fever. 3. Differential Exclusion: Severe Malaria is a primary differential in this region; however, the specific biphasic pattern, Faget's sign, and prominent hemorrhagic features (vomiting 'black' blood) are more specific to Yellow Fever than malaria. Lassa Fever is another hemorrhagic fever but typically presents with a more gradual onset and profound deafness, which is not described here. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the clinical picture in the context of an outbreak region with low vaccination coverage, and definitively by detecting specific IgM antibodies or viral RNA via PCR, as noted in the study's surveillance methodology.",10,10,5

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient presents in East Kalimantan, Indonesia (Southeast Asia), which is the specific endemic hotspot for the zoonotic parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, transmitted between macaques and humans. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark diagnostic clue is the discordance between the microscopic morphology and the parasite burden. The parasites resemble Plasmodium malariae (band forms, compact trophozoites), but P. malariae typically presents with very low parasitemia (<5,000/µL) due to its preference for older red blood cells. A 'P. malariae-like' parasite with high parasitemia (52,000/µL) and severe clinical features (neurocognitive impairment, severe anemia) is virtually pathognomonic for P. knowlesi. 3. Differential Exclusion: Plasmodium falciparum is a common cause of cerebral malaria but has distinct microscopic ring forms (delicate, multiple per cell, headphones) and usually causes microvascular sequestration not described here. Plasmodium malariae is excluded by the high parasite count and disease severity. Viral meningoencephalitis is excluded by the positive blood smear. 4.

His itinerary included a final month in Northern Thailand, specifically trekking in the Chiang Mai and Pai regions, where he reports frequent sightings of macaques but no direct contact or bites. He did not take malaria prophylaxis. Initial laboratory evaluation reveals leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminases. A rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria is negative for HRP2/Aldolase but shows a weak positive band for pan-LDH. An initial thick blood smear is negative, but a repeat smear performed three hours later reveals non-speciated Plasmodium parasites.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Plasmodium knowlesi Malaria,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient traveled to Southeast Asia, specifically Northern Thailand (a region where this zoonosis is emerging/expanding), and engaged in jungle trekking with exposure to macaques (the natural reservoir hosts). The lack of prophylaxis increases susceptibility. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of 'Dengue-like' symptoms (retro-orbital pain, thrombocytopenia) with a malaria smear that is initially difficult to detect or speciate is characteristic. Crucially, the RDT pattern (negative HRP2 for falciparum, weak pan-LDH) is a classic 'red flag' for non-falciparum malaria, specifically P. knowlesi, which often cross-reacts poorly or only with pan-markers. 3. Differential Exclusion: Dengue fever is a strong differential given the retro-orbital pain and thrombocytopenia, but is ruled out by the visualization of malaria parasites on the repeat smear. Plasmodium falciparum is unlikely given the negative HRP2 RDT. Plasmodium malariae is morphologically similar but typically presents with lower parasitemia and a slower replication cycle, whereas knowlesi can progress rapidly. 4.

Five other patients (all young males) present during the same period with similar fevers and microscopic findings. Despite the initial microscopic diagnosis, subsequent metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and specific PCR testing reveal a different etiology. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Plasmodium knowlesi Malaria,"1. **Epidemiology/Risk:** The patient is in Cambodia (Battambang Province), a region within the Greater Mekong Subregion where zoonotic malaria is an emerging concern. The patient demographic (young male) often correlates with forest work, a risk factor for exposure to the *Anopheles* vectors of simian malaria. 2. **Clinical Anchor:** The key diagnostic pivot is the discordance between the microscopic appearance and the molecular identity. The parasite was identified microscopically as *P. malariae* due to morphological similarities (band forms). However, *P. knowlesi* is notorious for morphologically mimicking *P. malariae* (in later stages) and *P. falciparum* (in early ring stages). 3. **Differential Exclusion:** *Plasmodium malariae* was the initial microscopic diagnosis but was incorrect. *Plasmodium falciparum* and *P. vivax* were effectively ruled out by the negative Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT), which typically detects HRP2 or pLDH antigens specific to those species. 4. **Confirmation:** The diagnosis is definitively established by advanced molecular methods (mNGS and species-specific PCR), which identified *Plasmodium knowlesi*  in this patient and the clustered cases, correcting the initial microscopic misdiagnosis.",10,10,5

One month prior, he sustained a dog bite to his left leg and hand; the animal subsequently escaped. He received four doses of a cell-culture rabies vaccine, with the last dose administered 5 days prior to presentation, but it is unknown if he received immunoglobulin. On physical examination, he is restless and disoriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 11. He exhibits nuchal rigidity and absent oculocephalic reflexes. Neurological exam reveals spastic quadriparesis with exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and bilateral extensor plantar responses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrates T2/FLAIR hyperintensities localized to the dorsal medulla, dorsal pons, midbrain, and bilateral hypothalami. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis (70 cells/mm3) with normal glucose. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Paralytic Rabies,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a history of a dog bite in a rabies-endemic region (Nepal). The development of symptoms despite vaccination suggests potential prophylaxis failure, possibly due to the lack of Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG) administration for a Category III exposure (multiple bites/transdermal bites). 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from a prodrome of fever to ascending paralysis and sphincter dysfunction (urinary retention) typically mimics Guillain-Barre Syndrome; however, the presence of altered mental status and specific MRI findings of hyperintensity in the dorsal brainstem, tegmentum, and hypothalamus anchors the diagnosis to a neurotropic viral encephalitis, specifically Rabies. 3. Differential Exclusion: Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is the primary differential for acute ascending paralysis, but GBS typically presents with flaccid (not spastic) paralysis, areflexia, and albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF rather than pleocytosis. Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a consideration given the recent vaccination, but the specific localization of lesions to the dorsal brainstem and the rapid, fatal progression despite steroid therapy strongly favor a viral etiology over a post-vaccinal demyelinating event. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed clinically by the fulminant course (death within days), the characteristic 'paralytic' presentation (which occurs in ~20% of cases), and the pathognomonic MRI distribution affecting the limbic system and brainstem, which corresponds to the virus's neuroanatomic predilection.",10,10,5

Clinical examination reveals dysphagia, hypersalivation, and unresponsiveness to stimuli. Despite supportive care, the animal dies shortly after symptom onset. A post-mortem examination of the brain reveals diffuse non-suppurative encephalitis characterized by perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, neuronal vacuolization, and specific acidophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies within neurons of the gray matter. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Paralytic Rabies,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The subject is a susceptible mammal (tapir) in a region (Northern Argentina) where the common vampire bat (*Desmodus rotundus*) is an endemic reservoir for viral pathogens. The 'paralytic' presentation in livestock and wild herbivores in this geographic area is a strong epidemiological signal. 2. Clinical Anchor: The rapid progression of neurological signs—specifically ascending paralysis (hind limb paresis to recumbency), dysphagia, and hypersalivation—anchors the diagnosis to a neurotropic viral infection affecting the brainstem and spinal cord. 3. Differential Exclusion: While Equine Encephalitis viruses (EEE/WEE) or West Nile Virus could cause encephalitis in perissodactyls, the specific histopathological finding of acidophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Negri bodies) is pathognomonic for Rabies and excludes other viral encephalitides. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is definitively confirmed by the detection of Rabies virus antigenic variant 3 (associated with *Desmodus rotundus*) via direct immunofluorescence and PCR, as described in the report.",10,10,5

Twenty-five days prior, he sustained a penetrating bite to the back of his right hand from a domestic dog; he received wound cleaning and a vaccine series but no immunoglobulin. On admission, he is febrile (38.8°C) and hypertensive (151/76 mmHg). Neurological examination reveals grade 0/5 strength in the distal right upper limb, grade 4/5 in the proximal left upper limb, and a positive Babinski sign on the left. Cranial CT is unremarkable. His condition deteriorates rapidly over the next 24 hours with the onset of respiratory arrest and coma. Routine CSF analysis shows a mild pleocytosis (25 x 10^6/L) and elevated protein (571 mg/L). What is the most likely diagnosis?",Paralytic Rabies,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a clear history of a high-risk exposure (penetrating dog bite, WHO Category III) in a rural setting without adequate post-exposure prophylaxis (no immunoglobulin administered). 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of localized paresthesia/numbness at the site of the bite (right hand) followed by progressive weakness (monoparesis evolving to quadriparesis) and fever is the classic prodrome and early neurological phase of rabies. The specific 'paralytic' (or 'dumb') form mimics Guillain-Barre or stroke but often retains the prodromal numbness at the inoculation site. 3. Differential Exclusion: Stroke is ruled out by the progressive nature of the weakness, fever, and normal CT scan. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is a strong differential due to paralysis, but GBS typically presents with ascending bilateral weakness and albuminocytologic dissociation (high protein, normal cells), whereas this patient had pleocytosis and asymmetric, descending/multifocal weakness starting at the bite site. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) of the cerebrospinal fluid, which identified specific reads mapping to the Rabies lyssavirus genome, highlighting the utility of this technology in atypical (paralytic) presentations.",10,10,5

The day prior to admission, she developed dysphagia and shortness of breath. On physical examination, she exhibits muscle spasms in the upper limbs, chest, and face that are triggered by auditory and photic stimuli. She also demonstrates involuntary contorting movements of the neck. An initial non-contrast brain CT is unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals normal glucose, elevated protein, and a normal white cell count. Over the next 24 hours, her condition rapidly deteriorates with the onset of autonomic instability (hypotension, intense sweating), urinary incontinence, and high-grade fever (39–40°C), necessitating intubation and ICU admission. Family history reveals that 42 days prior to symptom onset, she sustained a bite to the right index and middle fingers from a feral cat, for which she sought no medical attention. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Human Rabies (Secondary transmission from an insectivorous bat via a feral cat),". Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in Argentina (Buenos Aires province) and has a history of a bite from a feral cat 6 weeks prior. While canine rabies is controlled in many areas, insectivorous bats (*Tadarida brasiliensis*) remain a reservoir, and spillover to domestic animals (cats) can occur. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from prodromal paresthesias at the site of the bite (implied by hand weakness/paresthesia) to severe encephalomyelitis characterized by aerophobia/hydrophobia equivalents (spasms triggered by stimuli), autonomic instability, and fever is classic for Rabies. The 'contorting neck movements' and spasms are highly suggestive of the furious form. 3. Differential Exclusion: Tetanus could cause muscle spasms but typically presents with trismus and lacks the pleocytosis/encephalitic features (though CSF here was initially acellular, the rapid progression to cerebral edema seen on later CT fits viral encephalitis). Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) causes paralysis but not the stimulus-sensitive spasms or severe autonomic storms seen this early, nor the fever. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the clinical course (fatal encephalitis) and definitively by post-mortem detection of Rabies virus (Tadarida brasiliensis variant) via RT-qPCR and direct fluorescent antibody testing.",10,10,5

Differential Exclusion: Bacterial pneumonia is less likely given the interstitial pattern and lack of response to initial care. Leptospirosis can cause renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage but typically presents with conjunctival suffusion and jaundice, which are not described. Influenza is possible but less likely to cause such severe shock and renal failure in the absence of secondary bacterial infection. 4.

Initial CSF Gram stain and India ink preparation are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?
",Tuberculous Meningitis (complicated by Vasculitic Infarction),"  1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a migrant worker presenting with subacute constitutional symptoms (1-month fever, evening rise), a classic demographic and temporal profile for tuberculosis in endemic regions. 2. Clinical Anchor: The triad of **subacute fever**, **meningismus**, and **markedly elevated CSF protein (>1000 mg/dL)** with lymphocytic pleocytosis is highly specific for Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM). The specific neurological deficit—personality changes (frontal lobe) combined with paraplegia (leg area of motor homunculus)—strongly suggests a **vasculitic infarct** involving the bilateral Anterior Cerebral Arteries (ACA) or extensive spinal arachnoiditis, a known complication of TBM. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial Meningitis presents acutely with neutrophilic pleocytosis; Viral Encephalitis (e.g., HSV) typically has normal or mildly elevated protein and glucose; Spinal cord compression (e.g., Pott's disease) would explain the paraplegia but not the encephalopathy (mutism/confusion) or the diffuse meningeal signs. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is supported by the clinical syndrome of basal meningitis complicated by vasculopathy (stroke) and the characteristic 'froin-like' CSF profile (very high protein due to spinal block/stagnation), necessitating empiric anti-tubercular therapy despite initial negative stains.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an elderly male with a recent severe respiratory viral infection (COVID-19) and iatrogenic immunosuppression (tocilizumab/steroids), creating a perfect setup for secondary invasive bacterial superinfection, specifically Streptococcus pneumoniae. 2. Clinical Anchor: The classic meningeal triad of fever, rapidly progressive altered mental status (obtundation), and nuchal rigidity is the defining clinical anchor for acute bacterial meningitis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Acute Ischemic Stroke is a strong distractor given the sudden onset of hemiparesis and the known hypercoagulable state of COVID-19; however, stroke typically presents without fever or nuchal rigidity, and the inflammatory marker spike strongly favors an infectious etiology over a pure vascular event. 4.

Splenic abscesses are rare in other bacterial infections but occur in up to 50% of pediatric melioidosis cases. 3. Differential Exclusion: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is a primary differential given the location (fossa of Rosenmüller) and regional epidemiology, but it is ruled out by the acute febrile presentation, the presence of a splenic abscess, and the benign inflammatory biopsy. Tuberculosis could present similarly but typically has a more chronic course; the specific finding of a splenic abscess is more strongly predictive of melioidosis in this context. 4.

He reports no history of trauma or weight loss. Neurological examination reveals local tenderness over the L2-L3 spine but no motor or sensory deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine demonstrates spondylodiscitis at the L2-L3 level with a large prevertebral and bilateral psoas abscess, highly suggestive of Pott's spine (tuberculous spondylitis). Based on these findings, he is started on empiric anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). However, after 2 months of compliance, his symptoms worsen, and a follow-up MRI shows an increase in the size of the abscess. He undergoes surgical decompression and abscess drainage. Gram stain of the pus is negative, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and GeneXpert MTB/RIF are also negative. Histopathology reveals non-specific chronic inflammation. What is the most likely diagnosis?
",Melioidosis (Burkholderia pseudomallei),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a diabetic rice farmer from an endemic region (India), which is the classic high-risk profile for Melioidosis (*Burkholderia pseudomallei*) due to occupational exposure to contaminated soil and water. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of 'tuberculous-like' spondylodiscitis with psoas abscess that **fails to respond to empiric anti-tubercular therapy** is a critical diagnostic clue. Melioidosis is known as the 'Great Mimicker' and frequently presents as musculoskeletal infection (osteomyelitis/spondylitis) indistinguishable from TB on imaging. 3. Differential Exclusion: Tuberculosis (Pott's spine) is the primary differential but is ruled out by the lack of clinical response to ATT and negative specific microbiological tests (AFB/GeneXpert). Pyogenic spondylodiscitis (Staph aureus) usually presents more acutely and would likely show Gram-positive cocci. 4.

",Smear-Negative Pulmonary Tuberculosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a recent immigrant from an endemic region (Cuba) and has a significant occupational risk factor (construction work involving silica dust), which predisposes to mycobacterial infection (silicotuberculosis). 2. Clinical Anchor: The classic constellation of 'B-symptoms' (fever, night sweats, weight loss) combined with **hemoptysis** and **cavitary lung lesions** is the hallmark presentation of tuberculosis. The lower lobe location is an atypical but recognized presentation, particularly in primary or smear-negative disease. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial or atypical pneumonia is the initial working diagnosis, but the failure to respond to standard antibiotics and the subacute, consumptive nature of the symptoms (weight loss) strongly point away from a routine bacterial etiology. Lung abscess is possible but less likely given the specific epidemiologic risks and lack of aspiration history. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is established as **Smear-Negative Tuberculosis**; the negative sputum smears are a common diagnostic pitfall (occurring in 10-61% of cases) often due to lower bacillary burden, necessitating a high index of suspicion and confirmation via molecular testing (NAAT) or culture.

",Smear- and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-Negative Tuberculosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young female presenting with subacute respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, pleurisy) and constitutional signs (implied by high CRP/platelets) in the absence of other comorbidities. While she denies known exposure, the clinical picture of a unilateral exudative effusion in a young patient is highly suspicious for tuberculosis, especially in endemic settings or immigrant populations (though origin isn't specified in the vignette, the presentation is classic). 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of a **lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion** with **negative initial microbiological testing** (smear/PCR) is a classic presentation of pleural tuberculosis (paucibacillary disease).

He reports mild asthenia and a few episodes of diarrhea but explicitly denies fever, retro-orbital pain, or arthralgia. His medical history is significant for a documented episode of Dengue fever 15 years ago. Physical examination reveals a diffuse morbilliform exanthem sparing the face, with no palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

18,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4740642/,"A 23-year-old male presents with a two-week history of continuous high-grade fever, severe headache, and vomiting. Concurrent with the onset of fever, he noticed the development of three painless ulcers on his scrotum with serosanguinous discharge. His social history is significant for a recent pilgrimage where he consumed food from street vendors; he explicitly denies sexual contact or insect bites. On physical examination, he is febrile (38.8°C) and exhibits mild hepatosplenomegaly. Genital examination reveals circular, punched-out scrotal ulcers with a yellowish slough. Laboratory evaluation shows mild anemia and elevated liver transaminases (AST 174 U/L, ALT 195 U/L). Serological tests for HIV, syphilis (VDRL), and Hepatitis B are negative. Ophthalmology evaluation rules out uveitis. He is initially treated empirically with doxycycline, resulting in only transient improvement before symptoms recur. Blood cultures drawn at admission subsequently return positive. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Typhoid Fever (Salmonella Typhi with rare cutaneous ulceration),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient's history of a recent pilgrimage and consumption of street food is a classic risk factor for acquiring water-borne or food-borne enteric pathogens. 2. Clinical Anchor: The constellation of prolonged high-grade fever, headache, vomiting, hepatosplenomegaly, and transaminitis (typhoid hepatitis) is the textbook presentation of Enteric (Typhoid) Fever. 3. The Diagnostic Conundrum (Genital Ulcers): The presence of genital ulcers typically prompts a differential of STIs (syphilis, chancroid) or vasculitis (Behçet's disease). However, the patient denies sexual contact, VDRL is negative, and there are no other stigmata of Behçet's (oral ulcers, uveitis). 4. Pathophysiology: While 'Rose spots' are the common cutaneous finding in Typhoid, *Salmonella Typhi* can rarely cause non-specific genital ulcerations. These are often misdiagnosed as Lipschütz ulcers or STIs. 5. Confirmation: The positive blood culture confirms systemic Salmonella infection. The resolution of the ulcers following appropriate antibiotic therapy (ceftriaxone) confirms that the ulcers were a rare extra-intestinal manifestation of the high bacterial burden associated with Typhoid Fever.",8,10,5
21,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946370/,"A 20-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 24-hour history of severe abdominal pain and profuse, watery diarrhea. He also reports nausea and multiple episodes of vomiting. He recently returned from travel to Bangladesh. On examination, he is alert but appears severely dehydrated. Vital signs reveal hypotension (BP 85/56 mmHg), tachycardia, and a respiratory rate of 17 breaths/min. The abdomen is soft and distended. Initial laboratory investigations show marked neutrophilic leukocytosis, hemoconcentration (Hb 18.8 g/dL), and severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.1). There is also significant hyponatremia (Na 124 mmol/L), hypokalemia (K 2.9 mmol/L), and acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine (438 µmol/L) and rhabdomyolysis (CK 6,094 IU/L). Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, the patient remains anuric and requires hemodialysis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cholera (Vibrio cholerae infection) complicated by Acute Kidney Injury,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a clear epidemiological link: recent travel to Bangladesh, a region endemic for cholera. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of acute, profuse 'rice-water' diarrhea (implied by the severity and nature) leading to rapid, profound dehydration and hypovolemic shock is the hallmark of Cholera gravis. 3. Complication Profile: The profound fluid loss leads to a specific pattern of metabolic derangement: severe metabolic acidosis (due to bicarbonate loss in stool), hypokalemia, and pre-renal azotemia progressing to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The rhabdomyolysis is a less common but documented complication of severe electrolyte imbalance and shock. 4. Confirmation: The stool culture returning positive for *Vibrio cholerae* confirms the diagnosis. The clinical picture is driven by the cholera toxin causing massive chloride and water secretion.",8,4,3

He reports the sudden onset of nausea, profuse watery diarrhea (>20 episodes/day), and vomiting, which began on the day of his return flight. He denies fever. On admission, he is afebrile but critically ill with signs of severe dehydration: hypotension (BP 80/50 mmHg), tachycardia (120 bpm), tachypnea, dry mucous membranes, and anuria. The abdomen is distended but non-tender. Laboratory evaluation reveals hemoconcentration (Hematocrit 61.9%), severe acute kidney injury (Creatinine 3.81 mg/dL rising to 5.98 mg/dL), and metabolic acidosis. A multiplex gastrointestinal PCR panel is positive for two pathogens. Stool culture isolates a Gram-negative, comma-shaped bacterium. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cholera (Vibrio cholerae O1 infection) co-infected with Norovirus,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a clear epidemiological link: recent travel to Bangladesh, a known endemic hotspot for Cholera. The onset of symptoms immediately upon return suggests acquisition in the endemic zone. 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical presentation is classic for 'Cholera Gravis': acute, afebrile, profuse watery diarrhea leading to rapid, life-threatening dehydration, hypovolemic shock, and acute renal failure (anuria, elevated creatinine). 3. Differential Exclusion: While traveler's diarrhea (ETEC) is common, it rarely causes such profound dehydration and shock in an adult. The specific finding of 'comma-shaped' bacteria on culture is morphologically distinct for *Vibrio*. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the isolation of *Vibrio cholerae* O1 (specifically the El Tor biotype, Inaba serotype in this case report) from the stool. The multiplex PCR also identified a co-infection with Norovirus, which likely contributed to the vomiting, but the severity of the fluid loss and shock is driven by the cholera toxin.",8,10,5

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.7 C, blood pressure of 145/87 mmHg, and a pulse of 97 beats per minute. Physical examination reveals palpable cervical lymphadenopathy and a rash consisting of papules and pustules distributed over the face, trunk, and extremities. The rash involves the palms but notably spares the soles of the feet. Testing for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Mpox (Monkeypox),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a mobile worker (truck driver) with a history of cross-border travel and direct contact with a symptomatic individual and high-risk sexual contact, known vectors for transmission. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of a viral prodrome followed by a rash affecting the palms, along with prominent cervical lymphadenopathy, is the key clinical signature distinguishing this from other viral exanthems. 3. Differential Exclusion: Varicella (chickenpox) is the primary differential due to the rash, but Varicella typically presents with lesions in different stages of healing simultaneously (pleomorphism), rarely affects the palms, and does not typically cause the significant lymphadenopathy seen in this patient. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of skin scrapings, which detects Orthopoxvirus DNA (specifically Clade 1b in this case).",8,10,5

He denies sexual contact during his travel but notes sharing an apartment with friends and practicing poor hand hygiene. Physical examination reveals multiple discrete erythematous maculopapular and vesicular lesions distributed across the face, trunk, and extremities. Notably, necrotic papules with overlying scabs are observed on the penis and right thigh. Initial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of a genital lesion swab detects Orthopoxvirus DNA with a low cycle threshold. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Mpox (Clade Ib Monkeypox Virus Infection),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a critical epidemiological link: recent travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (specifically South Kivu), which is the epicenter for the novel Clade Ib outbreak. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a febrile prodrome associated with a disseminated rash that includes specific necrotic, scabbed papules on the genitalia is the clinical anchor. The progression from focal genital itching to systemic vesicular rash is characteristic. 3. Differential Exclusion: Varicella (chickenpox) could cause a disseminated vesicular rash, but lesions typically appear in crops at different stages and are superficial; furthermore, the specific finding of necrotic genital eschars is atypical for varicella. Secondary syphilis could cause a rash and genital lesions but usually presents with a non-pruritic maculopapular rash including palms/soles and painless chancres, rather than the painful, necrotic, vesiculopustular evolution seen here. 4.

The lesion initially appeared as a 4 cm inflamed nodule accompanied by fever, generalized malaise, myalgia, and cervical lymphadenopathy. She was previously treated for a presumed bacterial abscess with surgical drainage and oral antibiotics, but the wound has not resolved. Physical examination today reveals the open, draining chin wound and a new, distinct, umbilicated, pustular lesion on her right forearm. Detailed history taking reveals that she attended a party in Berlin recently, where she engaged in close non-sexual physical contact, specifically cuddling, with an individual who was later diagnosed with a viral exanthem. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Monkeypox (MPOX),"1. Epidemiology: The critical risk factor is the specific exposure history—close physical contact with a confirmed case. While the 2022 outbreak heavily affected men who have sex with men (MSM), this case highlights the potential for non-sexual transmission via close contact in heterosexual women. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presence of a primary inoculation site (the chin nodule) that mimics a bacterial abscess but fails to heal, followed by the appearance of a secondary, classic 'smallpox-like' umbilicated lesion on a distant site (forearm), is the key clinical signature. 3. Differential Exclusion: A bacterial abscess or impetigo (which was actually present as a superinfection) is the main distractor. However, a solitary bacterial infection would typically respond to drainage and antibiotics and would not produce the systemic viral prodrome or the subsequent characteristic pox-like lesion on the forearm. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis unifies the systemic symptoms, the atypical refractory primary lesion, and the secondary cutaneous findings with the reported exposure history.",8,10,5

Physical examination reveals scleral icterus and a painful hepatomegaly with a liver span of 22 cm. Laboratory evaluation shows a leukocytosis of 27,000/mm³ with a neutrophilic predominance (18,000/mm³). Tests for hepatitis B and C, as well as malaria trophozoites, are negative. Despite supportive care with fluids and antibiotics, his condition deteriorates with persistent bleeding and altered mental status (qSOFA score of 3), leading to death on the fifth day of hospitalization. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Yellow Fever,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient lives in Chad (Lai district), a region within the Yellow Fever endemic zone of Africa. His vaccination status is unknown in an area with documented low vaccination coverage (<80%). The lack of recent travel suggests local (autochthonous) urban transmission involving *Aedes* vectors. 2. Clinical Anchor: The triad of fever, jaundice, and hemorrhagic manifestations (epistaxis), accompanied by painful hepatomegaly and rapid progression to death (toxic phase), is the classic clinical anchor for severe Yellow Fever. 3. Differential Exclusion: Viral Hepatitis B and C were ruled out serologically. Malaria is a major differential in Chad but was excluded by negative blood smear. Lassa fever is possible but less likely to present with such profound, rapid hepatomegaly and immediate jaundice compared to Yellow Fever. 4.

Vital signs reveal a temperature of 38.0°C and a heart rate of 101 bpm. Physical examination demonstrates a blanching maculopapular rash but is notable for the absence of Koplik spots or cervical lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation shows lymphopenia (0.7 × 10^9/L) and elevated CRP (42 mg/L). A throat swab is positive for parainfluenza virus type 2. Despite antimicrobial therapy, her respiratory status rapidly deteriorates, requiring emergency cesarean section and subsequent transfer for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). What is the most likely diagnosis?
",Measles (Rubeola),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The most critical risk factor is the patient's lack of vaccination (MMR naive) combined with the immunocompromised state of pregnancy, which predisposes her to severe viral presentations. 2. Clinical Anchor: While the rash progression (palms to face) was atypical, the combination of a febrile exanthem with rapid progression to severe respiratory failure (ARDS) is a hallmark of severe measles pneumonia in pregnant women. 3. Differential Exclusion: Parainfluenza virus type 2 was identified via throat swab and serves as a major distractor; however, parainfluenza typically presents with mild upper respiratory symptoms and does not explain the severe disseminated dermatologic findings or the catastrophic respiratory collapse seen in this case. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by specific IgM and PCR testing, illustrating that classic signs like Koplik spots may be absent in pregnancy while the risk of life-threatening complications like pneumonia is significantly increased.

On arrival, he is afebrile but tachycardic (132 bpm) and tachypneic (30 breaths/min) with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. Pulmonary auscultation reveals bilateral rales. Laboratory evaluation is notable for leukocytosis (18,000/mm³) with a left shift, significant thrombocytopenia (platelets 31,000/mm³), and hyponatremia (129 mmol/L). A chest CT angiogram shows patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening, and small pleural effusions. Despite high-flow oxygen, his respiratory status deteriorates, requiring intubation for severe ARDS (P/F ratio 86) and vasopressors for shock. Further history reveals he has pet rodents at home.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from South-Eastern Europe (Romania), a region where Old World Hantaviruses (like Hantaan, Puumala, Dobrava) circulate, though cases can be rare and underdiagnosed. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a 'flu-like' prodrome (fever, GI symptoms) followed by hypotension, acute kidney injury (AKI), and severe thrombocytopenia is the classic triad for Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS). The specific finding of nephrotic-range proteinuria with hematuria mimics a nephritic syndrome but is typical for Hantavirus nephropathy. 3. Differential Exclusion: Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) was a major differential due to the thrombocytopenia and renal failure; however, it is less likely given the specific biopsy findings of medullary hemorrhage rather than microthrombi (and normal ADAMTS13 would exclude TTP).

",Tuberculous Meningitis (presenting as Cerebral Salt Wasting Syndrome),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient presents with subacute constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss) and neurological decline, a pattern highly suggestive of central nervous system tuberculosis in endemic regions. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is dominated by **Cerebral Salt Wasting (CSW)**, evidenced by the specific combination of hyponatremia, high urine sodium, and critically, **clinical hypovolemia** (orthostasis, dehydration, weight loss). This distinguishes it from SIADH. The underlying etiology is revealed by the CSF profile (high protein, low glucose, lymphocytic pleocytosis), which is classic for Tuberculous Meningitis even in the absence of initial meningeal signs. 3. Differential Exclusion: SIADH is the primary differential for hyponatremia with high urine sodium; however, SIADH is a volume-expanded or euvolemic state. This patient's clear signs of volume depletion (orthostasis, weight loss) rule out SIADH. Bacterial meningitis typically presents more acutely with higher cell counts and neutrophilia. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is pathologically confirmed by the detection of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* in the CSF (via culture or PCR/GeneXpert), explaining the meningeal inflammation that precipitated the salt-wasting state.

He denies any recent history of head trauma or cranial surgery. On physical examination, the patient exhibits marked nuchal rigidity, photophobia, and phonophobia. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain is obtained, revealing  two subtle air bubbles adjacent to the left-sided tentorium cerebelli. A subsequent MRI demonstrates asymmetric hyperintensity on FLAIR sequences and subtle contrast enhancement of the meninges in the corresponding area. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pneumococcal Meningitis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient presents with an acute bacterial meningitis syndrome (headache, fever implied by infection, nuchal rigidity) in a middle-aged adult, a demographic where *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is the most common community-acquired bacterial pathogen. 2. Clinical Anchor: The critical and unusual radiological finding is spontaneous, atraumatic pneumocephalus (intracranial gas). While typically associated with trauma or surgery, the presence of intracranial air in a patient with meningeal signs is a rare but specific indicator of a gas-producing bacterial infection (pyogenic meningitis). 3. Differential Exclusion: Viral meningitis is a leading consideration for meningeal signs; however, it is strictly excluded here by the presence of pneumocephalus, as viral pathogens do not produce gas. 4.

He reports a subjective fever accompanied by headache, conjunctivitis, and sore throat. Additional symptoms include diffuse myalgias, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Notably, physical examination reveals no evidence of a rash. He denies any recent travel or sick contacts within his household. The illness is self-limited, resolving fully within three weeks with only supportive care (acetaminophen). Diagnostic evaluation of acute-phase serum collected two days after symptom onset is negative for Dengue and Chikungunya viruses via reverse transcription PCR. Subsequent paired serological testing is also negative for Dengue, Chikungunya, and Japanese Encephalitis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Zika Virus Infection,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in the Philippines, a region with known *Aedes* mosquito vectors, supporting autochthonous transmission of arboviruses. The absence of travel history confirms local acquisition. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a mild, self-limited undifferentiated febrile illness characterized by fever, non-purulent conjunctivitis, and myalgia is highly suggestive of a flavivirus infection. While rash is common in this condition, its absence (as seen here) does not preclude the diagnosis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Dengue fever is the most prominent differential diagnosis in this setting due to the overlap of fever, myalgia, and headache; however, it is definitively excluded by negative acute-phase PCR and convalescent serology. Chikungunya is similarly excluded by negative molecular and serological testing. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of viral RNA in the serum using real-time reverse transcription PCR (targeting the membrane protein gene) and subsequent sequencing which identified the Asian lineage of the virus.",8,10,5

Physical examination reveals bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis and periarticular edema. Two days following her initial presentation, she returns with acute clinical deterioration, reporting profound fatigue, vomiting, and new-onset dyspnea. Vital signs demonstrate hypotension (103/81 mm Hg) and tachycardia (120 bpm). Laboratory evaluation is notable for markedly elevated Creatine Kinase (4,027 U/L), CK-MB (99 U/L), and Troponin T (0.27 ng/mL). A chest radiograph shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) reveals pericardial thickening, moderate pericardial effusion , and intramyocardial late gadolinium enhancement in the basal medial anterior septal wall. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Zika Virus-associated Myopericarditis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient presents in an endemic region (Brazil) with the classic triad of an acute arboviral infection: fever, maculopapular rash, and non-purulent conjunctivitis. 2. Clinical Anchor: The pivotal clinical turn is the rapid progression from a benign viral exanthem to hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia) and cardiac injury (elevated troponins), which, combined with the specific cMRI findings of inflammatory enhancement and effusion, anchors the diagnosis to a viral cardiac complication. 3. Differential Exclusion: Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) is a primary differential given the hypotension and enzyme elevation; however, it is excluded by the patient's viral prodrome, the specific non-ischemic pattern of fibrosis on MRI (intramyocardial rather than subendocardial), and preserved coronary perfusion. Dengue myocarditis is a consideration but was ruled out via PCR. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the positive real-time RT-PCR for Zika virus in blood and urine samples, establishing the specific viral etiology of the myopericardial inflammation.",8,10,5

The wife reports that on the sixth day of their trip, she experienced the sudden onset of fever, malaise, headache, diffuse myalgias, and a skin rash on her torso, which required a brief hospitalization abroad. The husband reports a concurrent but milder illness characterized by fever and a faint rash. On physical examination, both patients are currently afebrile. The wife exhibits mild, non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy; the husband's examination is unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation is initiated to rule out arboviral etiologies. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) testing of blood and urine samples is negative for Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. However, viral RNA is detected in the wife's serum and urine, and in the husband's urine. Serologic testing demonstrates positive IgM for the suspected pathogen, with noted cross-reactivity to Dengue virus.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Zika Virus Infection,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The couple has a clear travel history to the Caribbean (Cuba), an endemic region for arboviral transmission, which is the primary risk factor. The case highlights the risk of importation into non-endemic regions (like Greece) by travelers. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of acute fever, maculopapular rash, myalgia, and headache is the classic clinical syndrome for Zika, often indistinguishable clinically from Dengue or Chikungunya. 3. Differential Exclusion: Dengue virus is a top differential given the location and symptoms; however, it is excluded by the negative RT-PCR for Dengue and the explanation that the positive Dengue serology represents cross-reactivity (IgM) and prior Yellow Fever vaccination (IgG). 4.

He has a recent medical history of Crohn's disease, diagnosed five months prior, for which he was treated with a combination of oral corticosteroids and azathioprine. Although his initial inflammatory bowel symptoms improved, allowing for a taper of the steroids, his gastrointestinal symptoms have recently recurred and worsened despite ongoing immunosuppressive therapy. Physical examination is notable for the absence of any cutaneous or mucosal lesions. A follow-up colonoscopy reveals scarring in the colon and new, distinct inflammatory polypoid lesions in the terminal ileum. A small bowel series demonstrates multiple smooth-surface round filling defects throughout the jejunum and ileum . Abdominal computed tomography (CT) confirms diffuse edematous changes and multiple nodular lesions in the small bowel. Biopsy of the ileal lesions reveals spindle cells arranged in intersecting fascicles with slit-like vascular spaces containing erythrocytes. Immunohistochemistry is positive for CD34 and Human Herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) but negative for CD117 and cytomegalovirus. Serological testing for HIV is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Iatrogenic Kaposi Sarcoma (Intestinal),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is on immunosuppressive therapy (azathioprine and corticosteroids) for Crohn's disease. Iatrogenic immunosuppression is a well-established risk factor for the development of Kaposi Sarcoma (KS), distinct from the HIV-associated epidemic form. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of new visceral lesions (polypoid tumors in the small bowel) in an immunosuppressed patient, particularly with the specific histological finding of spindle cells with slit-like vascular spaces, is the classic pathological signature of KS. 3. Differential Exclusion: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) is a primary differential for submucosal ileal tumors; however, the negative CD117/DOG1 and positive HHV-8 immunohistochemistry definitively rule this out. Recurrence of Crohn's disease is unlikely to present as discrete polypoid masses with this specific histology. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the positive immunohistochemical staining for HHV-8 (LANA-1), the etiologic agent of all forms of Kaposi Sarcoma, in the context of iatrogenic immunosuppression and HIV seronegativity.",8,10,5

He had recently completed 15 cycles of liposomal doxorubicin for KS control. On admission, he is febrile (38.7°C), hypotensive, and tachycardic. Initial evaluation reveals severe anemia (hemoglobin 4.6 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets 128,000/µL), and hypoalbuminemia (2.3 g/dL). Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and multiple blood transfusions, his condition rapidly deteriorates into hemodynamic shock and respiratory failure requiring intubation and vasopressor support. A lumbar puncture is negative for bacterial meningitis but positive for Epstein-Barr virus (treated with ganciclovir). Notable laboratory findings include a markedly elevated C-reactive protein (20.84 mg/dL) and Interleukin-6 (20.16 pg/mL), along with significant hyperbilirubinemia. There is no evidence of Multicentric Castleman Disease (MCD) on imaging (no significant lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly). What is the most likely diagnosis explaining this systemic inflammatory presentation?",Kaposi Sarcoma Inflammatory Cytokine Syndrome (KICS),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has advanced AIDS and coinfection with Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8), the obligate risk factors for KICS. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation mimics severe sepsis (fever, shock, respiratory failure) but is distinguished by the lack of response to antibiotics, the presence of severe anemia/thrombocytopenia, and the specific elevation of KSHV-associated cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10). 3. Differential Exclusion: Sepsis is excluded by negative cultures and lack of response to antibiotics. Multicentric Castleman Disease (MCD) is a close mimic but typically presents with prominent lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, which are absent here. Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) is unlikely given the lack of recent ART initiation or CD4 recovery correlation. 4.

She has since recovered from the respiratory infection. Physical examination reveals multiple bilateral, asymptomatic, purplish tender macular lesions on the plantar surfaces. On the left sole, there is a distinct, large violaceous patch with irregular borders and peripheral nodules. Dermoscopy of the lesions demonstrates a reddish-violaceous diffuse homogenous pattern . Laboratory evaluation is significant for positive HHV-8 antibodies, but HIV serology and HCV-RNA are negative. Chest X-ray is unremarkable.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an elderly female who underwent significant iatrogenic immunosuppression (systemic steroids) for COVID-19, a known trigger for reactivating latent HHV-8. 2. Clinical Anchor: The appearance of violaceous macules, patches, and nodules specifically on the lower extremities (plantar region) is the classic cutaneous presentation of this angioproliferative tumor. 3. Differential Exclusion: Chilblains (or 'COVID toes') is a critical differential given the recent SARS-CoV-2 infection and foot location; however, chilblains typically present as inflammatory pernio-like lesions rather than the irregular, neoplastic violaceous patches seen here, and would not show spindle cell proliferation on biopsy. 4.

Physical examination reveals a diffuse macular rash with pinpoint petechiae on the lower limbs but is otherwise unremarkable. Initial laboratory evaluation for neonatal sepsis reveals significant thrombocytopenia (30,000/µL initially, worsening despite antibiotics) but normal renal function and negative blood cultures. A trial of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Cefotaxime/Amikacin, then Meropenem) yields no clinical improvement. The mother is asymptomatic and afebrile. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Postnatally Acquired Dengue Fever,"1. **Epidemiology/Risk:** The patient is a neonate in an endemic region (Nepal) presenting with fever and thrombocytopenia. While neonates are typically protected by maternal antibodies for the first 6 months, this protection is not absolute, and postnatal transmission (via mosquito bite) is possible. 2. **Clinical Anchor:** The clinical anchor is the combination of *refractory thrombocytopenia* and *fever* in a neonate unresponsive to standard sepsis antibiotics, accompanied by a *petechial rash*. This pattern, especially in an endemic area, strongly points towards a viral hemorrhagic fever. 3. **Differential Exclusion:** Bacterial sepsis is the primary differential but is less likely given the negative blood cultures and lack of response to Meropenem. Vertical transmission of Dengue is excluded because the mother is asymptomatic and serologically negative (NS1, IgM, IgG negative). TORCH infections could present similarly but typically have other stigmata (hepatosplenomegaly, etc.) which are not described. 4. **Confirmation:** The diagnosis is confirmed by the positive NS1 antigen and IgM antibody in the neonate, contrasting with the negative serology in the mother, establishing the postnatal (vector-borne) route of transmission.",8,10,5

Presumed to have an intramedullary tumor, she is started on corticosteroids with only partial relief. Repeat imaging one month later shows mild enlargement of the spinal lesions and the new appearance of multiple enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the mediastinal nodes reveals granulomatous inflammation with foci of necrosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Spinal Intramedullary Tuberculosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient originates from an endemic region (India), where tuberculosis is the leading cause of granulomatous disease. 2. Clinical Anchor: The pivotal finding is the emergence of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy in the setting of an undiagnosed spinal cord lesion. While the spinal presentation mimicked a neoplasm, the systemic involvement (lymph nodes) provided the accessible site for tissue diagnosis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Intramedullary spinal cord tumors (e.g., astrocytoma, ependymoma) were the initial consideration; however, these would not cause necrotizing granulomatous mediastinal adenopathy. Sarcoidosis is a differential for granulomatous disease but typically presents with non-necrotizing granulomas, whereas the necrosis seen here strongly favors tuberculosis. 4. Confirmation: The histologic finding of necrotizing granulomas, combined with the subsequent radiologic resolution of the spinal lesions following anti-tuberculosis therapy, confirms the diagnosis.",6,10,5

Initial labs show elevated transaminases (AST 106, ALT 97) and LDH (682), but normal hemoglobin. Viral hepatitis serologies are negative. An EGD reveals three gastric ulcers with black hemorrhagic spots in the antrum and midbody; biopsies show only chronic gastritis. On hospital day 5, she develops hematochezia with a hemoglobin drop and a spike in liver enzymes (AST 442). Blood cultures collected on admission return positive. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Typhoid Fever (Salmonella Typhi with Gastric Ulcer Bleeding),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient presents with a systemic febrile illness accompanied by gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic involvement (transaminitis). 2. Ruling out Common Causes: The negative viral hepatitis panel and the absence of alcohol or NSAID use make common causes of hepatitis and peptic ulcer disease unlikely. 3. Clinical Anchor: The combination of high fever, RUQ pain (hepatitis), and GI bleeding is the classic 'Typhoid state.' While Salmonella Typhi typically affects the terminal ileum (Peyer's patches), causing lower GI bleeding, this case illustrates a rare presentation where the organism causes gastric ulceration. 4. Confirmation: The isolation of *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhi from blood cultures confirms the diagnosis.

Laboratory evaluation shows a precipitous drop in leukocytes (3.1 x 10^9/L) and platelets (28 x 10^9/L). On hospital day 5, she develops a dry cough, dyspnea, and narrowing pulse pressure. Imaging confirms right-sided pleural effusion and mild ascites. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Concurrent Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Typhoid Fever,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient presents in Pakistan during a Dengue outbreak. The initial 15-day illness with gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, abdominal pain) is classic for Enteric Fever, common in this region. 2. Clinical Anchor: The 'Double-Hit' phenomenon is the key. The patient improved on antibiotics (consistent with treating the bacterial Typhoid) but then developed a *new*, distinct high-grade fever with hemorrhagic signs (gum bleeding, conjunctival hemorrhage) and 'breakbone' symptoms (retro-orbital pain). 3. Differential Exclusion: The sudden development of severe thrombocytopenia and leukopenia is characteristic of Dengue, not typical treated Typhoid. The progression to pleural effusion and ascites (plasma leakage) with narrowing pulse pressure confirms Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF). 4. Confirmation: The seroconversion of Dengue IgM on day 7, combined with the earlier positive Typhidot IgM and clinical response to antibiotics, confirms the rare coinfection.",6,10,5

However, at the 22nd hour, he experiences a syncopal episode lasting 40 seconds, followed by vomiting. A second syncopal episode occurs two hours later. He is transferred to a higher-level facility where a third syncopal episode occurs. On examination, he is afebrile (36.5°C) with a blood pressure of 105/65 mmHg, but notably, his electrocardiogram reveals sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 40 bpm. An atropine challenge test (0.04 mg/kg IV) fails to significantly increase the heart rate (increasing only to 53 bpm), initially suggesting sick sinus syndrome. Initial laboratory workup shows a normal white blood cell count (4.7 G/L) and negative malaria and dengue rapid tests. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Typhoid Fever (complicated by Relative Bradycardia/Faget Sign),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is in South Sudan, an endemic region for *Salmonella Typhi*. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation begins with a febrile gastrointestinal illness (diarrhea, fever) but pivots to a cardiovascular presentation (recurrent syncope). The key finding is the profound bradycardia (40 bpm) in a young, otherwise healthy male. 3. The Pathophysiological Link: This is an extreme manifestation of 'Relative Bradycardia' (Faget sign), a classic sign of Typhoid fever where the heart rate does not rise commensurately with fever (or remains low). In this case, it manifested as severe sinus bradycardia causing syncope. 4. Differential Exclusion: Sick Sinus Syndrome was considered due to the negative atropine test; however, the preceding febrile illness and the patient's young age make a primary cardiac conduction disorder less likely than a toxic-infectious etiology. 5. Confirmation: The Widal test and blood culture positive for *Salmonella Typhi* confirm the diagnosis. The resolution of bradycardia and syncope following antibiotic therapy (ciprofloxacin) confirms the infectious etiology.",6,9,5

She reports returning from a trip to Hawaii two weeks ago. She is initially admitted for suspected pyelonephritis or appendicitis and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin), but her symptoms persist. Laboratory evaluation reveals metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. A multiplex PCR stool panel is performed. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cholera (Vibrio cholerae infection) complicated by Acute Kidney Injury,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is immunocompromised (chronic steroids) and recently traveled to Hawaii (potential exposure to seafood/environmental reservoirs). While Cholera is rare in the US, the travel history and immune status are relevant. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is dominated by 'treatment-refractory' diarrhea and significant electrolyte derangements (hypokalemia), which are hallmarks of secretory diarrhea. 3. The Diagnostic Twist: The initial presentation mimicked appendicitis or pyelonephritis (RLQ pain, fever, dysuria), acting as distractors. The development of metabolic alkalosis is somewhat atypical (usually acidosis in cholera due to bicarbonate loss), potentially confounded by vomiting or other factors in this specific case report, but the refractory nature of the diarrhea is key. 4. Confirmation: The multiplex PCR panel is the definitive diagnostic tool here, identifying *Vibrio cholerae* when common pathogens were negative.

She is started on empiric antibiotics for a suspected UTI. However, blood cultures rapidly grow a Gram-negative organism. Abdominal CT reveals common bile duct dilatation and heterogeneous liver enhancement consistent with cholangitis, but no biliary obstruction. She is not immunocompromised and denies recent travel or seafood consumption. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Vibrio cholerae Bacteremia (Non-O1/Non-O139) secondary to Ascending Cholangitis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: While *Vibrio cholerae* is typically associated with profuse diarrhea in endemic settings (O1/O139 serogroups), non-O1/non-O139 strains (NOVC) act as opportunistic pathogens. The patient's history of extensive biliary surgery is the critical risk factor here, altering the local flora and predisposing to ascending infection. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is one of sepsis and ascending cholangitis (abdominal pain, fever, biliary dilation on CT) rather than gastroenteritis. The absence of seafood exposure or travel makes marine *Vibrio* species (like *V. vulnificus*) less likely. 3. Differential Exclusion: Common causes of cholangitis (*E. coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Enterococcus*) are the primary differentials. However, the isolation of *Vibrio cholerae* from the blood in a patient without classic cholera symptoms points to an extra-intestinal infection with a non-toxigenic strain. 4. Confirmation: Blood cultures growing *Vibrio cholerae* confirm the diagnosis. The case illustrates that NOVC can colonize the biliary tree in patients with altered anatomy and cause bacteremia even in the absence of classic immunosuppression.",6,5,5

A skin examination identifies distinct lesions in the groin area that display central necrosis and scabbing. Additionally, a diffuse rash has emerged on the upper extremities and chest, characterized by firm pustules with central umbilication. The patient reports new-onset fatigue and anorexia. Social history is significant for unprotected sexual contact with a male partner who recently returned from international travel. A CT scan of the neck shows acute tonsillitis without abscess formation, and rapid screens for HIV, syphilis, and gonorrhea are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Monkeypox (Mpox),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a clear epidemiological risk factor: intimate contact within the MSM population involving a partner with recent international travel, suggesting a communicable viral pathogen prevalent in specific networks. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark finding is the progression of the rash from localized lesions to a centrifugal distribution of deep-seated, firm, umbilicated pustules, accompanied by significant lymphadenopathy (submandibular and inguinal), which is a distinguishing feature of Monkeypox compared to smallpox or varicella. 3. Differential Exclusion: Varicella (chickenpox) is a differential due to the vesicular rash; however, varicella lesions are typically superficial, distinct stages of development (crops) are seen simultaneously, and severe lymphadenopathy is less common in adults compared to the prominent lymphadenopathy seen here.

Physical examination reveals tender inguinal lymphadenopathy and a vesicular erythematous rash concentrated in the perianal and genital areas, with scattered lesions on the trunk and upper limbs. He reports the lesions are intensely pruritic and painful, and pain relief with NSAIDs has been ineffective. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Monkeypox (MPOX),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient fits the primary demographic profile of the 2022 non-endemic outbreak (MSM) with the key risk factor of unprotected sexual intercourse, rather than travel to endemic regions like West Africa. 2.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in an endemic area (São Paulo state, Brazil) during a known period of high arboviral circulation (2018), exposing him to multiple mosquito-borne vectors. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of acute undifferentiated febrile illness with hepatic inflammation (elevated GGT/transaminases) and leukocytosis, combined with negative initial serological rapid tests, necessitates molecular investigation. The 'anchor' is the detection of genetic material from two distinct viral families in a single host. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial sepsis is a strong differential given the high leukocytosis and CRP, but is excluded by negative blood and urine cultures. Isolated Dengue or Yellow Fever are plausible, but the specific molecular results identify both, making a single infection incorrect. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is definitively established by multiplex qRT-PCR, which detects viral RNA from both Dengue virus (serotype 2) and Yellow Fever virus simultaneously.",6,5,5

On admission, she is comatose with rhythmic movements of the right lower extremity, diffuse hyperreflexia, and bilateral Babinski signs. Brain MRI reveals restricted diffusion and T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the paramedian frontal lobes, insular cortices, and basal ganglia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrates a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (7 cells/µL), elevated protein (54 mg/dL), and positive 14-3-3 and Tau proteins. RT-QuIC for prion disease is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Yellow Fever Vaccine-Associated Neurotropic Disease (YEL-AND),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an older adult (>60 years) who received the 17D live attenuated Yellow Fever vaccine. Age is a significant risk factor for vaccine-associated adverse events. The onset of neurological symptoms (dizziness, diplopia) occurred within the classic 2–4 week post-vaccination window. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from mild neurological symptoms to severe meningoencephalitis (seizures, coma) with specific MRI findings (basal ganglia and cortical involvement) in the context of recent vaccination is the key anchor. 3. Differential Exclusion: Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a strong differential given the rapid neurological decline, myoclonus-like seizure activity, and MRI findings (cortical ribboning/basal ganglia signal), plus positive 14-3-3/Tau. However, it is excluded by the negative RT-QuIC (a specific test for prions) and the acute inflammatory context linked to vaccination. Autoimmune encephalitis is unlikely given the negative paraneoplastic panel. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of specific Yellow Fever IgM antibodies in the CSF, indicating neuroinvasion by the vaccine virus, and the exclusion of other etiologies.",6,`10,5

On examination, she is comatose with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 (E1V1M3). Her pupils are equal and reactive to light. Neurological assessment reveals generalized hypertonia and flexor posturing to painful stimuli; deep tendon reflexes are preserved, but plantar responses are equivocal. Terminal neck rigidity is noted. Routine metabolic panels and blood cultures are unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrates a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (20 cells/µL), elevated protein (70 mg/dL), and normal glucose. MRI of the brain  reveals symmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities involving the basal ganglia, thalami, and ventral pons. Further history obtained from the family reveals she was bitten on the leg by a jackal one month prior and received only three doses of a vaccine without immunoglobulin. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Rabies Encephalitis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The critical epidemiological factor is the history of a wild animal bite (jackal) one month prior to symptom onset, which aligns with the typical incubation period for Rabies. The patient received incomplete post-exposure prophylaxis (delayed vaccination and no immunoglobulin), leaving her susceptible. 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical presentation of acute, progressive encephalitis (fever, seizures, rapid decline in consciousness) combined with the specific MRI pattern—hyperintensities in the brainstem (pons), thalamus, and basal ganglia—anchors the diagnosis. This distribution reflects the neurotropism of the virus. 3. Differential Exclusion: Japanese Encephalitis is a strong differential in endemic regions and can cause thalamic lesions; however, it was excluded by negative CSF serology and lacks the specific animal bite history. Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) could be considered given the recent vaccination history, but ADEM typically involves white matter rather than the deep gray matter and brainstem predilection seen here. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the synthesis of the exposure history (jackal bite), the failure of adequate prophylaxis, the fulminant clinical course leading to coma and death, and the characteristic neuroimaging findings that rule out other viral or autoimmune etiologies.",6,8,5

Clinical Anchor: The presentation mimics inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis/Crohn's) but is distinguished by the specific histological finding of intracellular yeast cells that divide by binary fission (transverse septum), which is pathognomonic for Talaromyces marneffei. 3. Differential Exclusion: Histoplasmosis is the primary histological differential as it also presents as intracellular yeasts; however, Histoplasma capsulatum reproduces by budding (narrow-based buds) rather than fission, and the 'sausage-link' morphology seen here is specific to Talaromyces. Crohn's disease is excluded by the failure of immunosuppressive therapy and the presence of fungal elements. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the specific morphological identification of the fission yeast in colonic tissue and the clinical resolution following targeted antifungal therapy with itraconazole.",6,10,5

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young male construction worker (occupational exposure to soil) from an endemic region (India), which is a classic risk profile for Melioidosis (*Burkholderia pseudomallei*), even in the absence of diabetes. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a 'pyogenic-like' brain abscess (fever, headache, hemiparesis, ring-enhancing lesion) that mimics tuberculosis but occurs in a soil-exposed individual is a key diagnostic cue. The 'diagnostic challenge' highlighted in the source text is distinguishing this from TB or standard bacterial abscesses. 3. Differential Exclusion: Tuberculosis is the primary differential (ring-enhancing lesion, endemic area) but is less likely given the negative specific workup and the purulent nature of the abscess found at surgery. Pyogenic bacterial abscesses (Staph/Strep) usually have a primary source (dental/cardiac/ENT) which is absent here. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the culture of *Burkholderia pseudomallei* from the pus drained during craniotomy, necessitating a specific and prolonged antibiotic regimen (e.g., Ceftazidime/Meropenem followed by TMP-SMX).

",Smear-Negative Pulmonary Tuberculosis (associated with Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young male presenting with Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy (HOA), which is most commonly secondary to pulmonary malignancies (80% of cases) or chronic infections. In specific epidemiological contexts (like this case from Morocco), tuberculosis remains a critical consideration even in the absence of classic respiratory symptoms. 2. Clinical Anchor: The triad of **digital clubbing**, **periostosis** (periosteal reaction on X-ray), and **polyarthralgia** defines Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy (Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome). The key diagnostic pivot is the incidental finding of an **apical pulmonary cavity** on CT. 3. Differential Exclusion: Lung cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) is the primary differential for secondary HOA but is less likely given the patient's age and the specific cavitary morphology without a distinct mass. Primary HOA (Pachydermoperiostosis) is ruled out by the presence of pulmonary pathology and the lack of skin findings like pachydermia or cutis verticis gyrata. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the specific response to empiric anti-tubercular therapy (resolution of joint symptoms and regression of the cavity), establishing the etiology as Smear-Negative Pulmonary Tuberculosis despite the initial negative microbiological workup.

Laboratory evaluation shows thrombocytopenia (platelets 128,000/mm³) but is otherwise unremarkable for leukocytes and liver enzymes. A skin biopsy of a bullous lesion demonstrates spongiosis, papillary dermal edema, and a superficial perivascular lympho-histiocytic infiltrate with eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence is negative. Serologies for HIV, Hepatitis A, B, C, and Syphilis are non-reactive. Malaria smear is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Dengue Fever (presenting with hemorrhagic bullae),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a clear epidemiological risk factor: recent travel to Laos (Southeast Asia), a region endemic for arboviral diseases like Dengue. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of acute febrile illness with a rash and significant hemodynamic instability (shock/hypotension) is the clinical anchor. While the rash has atypical features (bullae), the 'white islands in a sea of red' pattern (confluent erythema with sparing) described in the full text and the presence of petechiae/thrombocytopenia are strong pointers toward a viral hemorrhagic fever. 3. Differential Exclusion: Autoimmune bullous diseases (e.g., bullous pemphigoid) are excluded by the acute febrile onset and negative direct immunofluorescence. Drug eruptions (SJS/TEN) are less likely due to the lack of mucosal involvement and negative Nikolsky sign. Malaria is excluded by the negative smear. 4.

On current admission, reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) of the blood detects viral RNA, and he is admitted to an isolation unit. Over the next six days, his systemic symptoms improve, and repeat blood PCR testing becomes negative. However, his clinical course is complicated by the sudden onset of agitation, spatial disorientation, and dysarthria, progressing to coma. A lumbar puncture is performed. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reveals the presence of viral RNA, despite the concurrent negative blood PCR. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ebola Virus Disease (Recrudescent Meningoencephalitis),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a survivor of a recent Ebola outbreak (5 months post-recovery). This history is critical as it raises the possibility of viral persistence in immune-privileged sites (eyes, testes, CNS). 2. Clinical Anchor: The biphasic clinical course is the key anchor. The patient initially presents with a mild systemic recurrence (viremia) that clears, only to be followed by a severe, isolated neurological deterioration (meningoencephalitis). 3. Differential Exclusion: A new primary infection (Reinfection) is a consideration; however, the specific dissociation between the blood (negative) and the CSF (positive) argues against acute systemic reinfection and strongly supports reactivation from a sanctuary site. Other causes of encephalitis (e.g., cerebral malaria) would not explain the initial viral PCR positivity. 4. Confirmation: The detection of Ebola Virus RNA in the CSF, in the absence of viremia, confirms the diagnosis of recrudescent meningoencephalitis caused by viral persistence in the central nervous system.",5,5,4

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient presents with a severe diarrheal illness following the consumption of raw seafood in a coastal region. While South Korea is not typically associated with large cholera outbreaks, this case highlights the risk of environmental acquisition from seawater reservoirs during periods of high water temperature. 2. Clinical Anchor: The pivotal clinical feature is the rapid progression from nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms to life-threatening dehydration and acute renal failure (requiring dialysis). This severity distinguishes 'Cholera Gravis' from routine food poisoning. 3. Differential Exclusion: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the most common cause of seafood-associated gastroenteritis in this region but typically causes a self-limiting illness and rarely leads to renal failure requiring CRRT. Vibrio vulnificus is a major differential for severe seafood-borne illness but typically presents with septicemia and necrotizing skin lesions, particularly in patients with liver disease, which this patient lacks. 4.

Clinical Anchor: The clinical scenario describes the specific entity of 'Smear-Negative, Radiologically Positive' disease; the persistent upper lobe opacities and B-symptoms despite negative sputum smears are highly characteristic of paucibacillary pulmonary tuberculosis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial pneumonia is ruled out by the chronic course and failure to respond to standard antibiotics. Lung malignancy is a consideration but is less likely to cause the specific 'evening rise' fever pattern and is a diagnosis of exclusion after infection is ruled out. 4.

Clinical Anchor: The systematic review of repellents marketed in Brazil identified that DEET-based products (specifically 10-25% concentrations) demonstrated superior percentage repellency and longer protection times compared to other agents tested against *Aedes* species. 3. Differential Exclusion: Botanical repellents such as Citronella and Eucalyptus oil are common distractors; however, the study explicitly found them to have significantly shorter protection times compared to DEET. While Icaridin and IR3535 are effective, the specific comparative data in this review highlighted DEET's superior performance in percentage repellency against *Aedes* spp. over these alternatives in the formulations tested. 4. Confirmation: The review concludes that DEET is the most effective repellent among the synthetic and natural options analyzed for protection against *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* in the Brazilian market.

",Lymphocutaneous Sporotrichosis (Severe Form),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from Rio de Janeiro, a hyperendemic region for zoonotic sporotrichosis (specifically *Sporothrix brasiliensis*), typically transmitted via infected cats. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of nodules and ulcers spreading proximally along lymphatic channels (sporotrichoid spread) is the classic sign of lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis. The 'verrucous' and 'confluent' nature highlights a severe presentation. 3. Differential Exclusion: Cutaneous Leishmaniasis can present with sporotrichoid spread but typically forms well-demarcated ulcers ('pizza-like') rather than the confluent, crusty, verrucous plaques seen here; Nocardiosis is a differential but less common in immunocompetent patients without specific environmental inoculation history. 4.

The case highlights that lesions above the umbilicus drain to the axilla and those below to the inguinal region, creating a unique diagonal pattern of spread distinct from the linear spread seen on limbs. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial abscess (e.g., *Staph aureus*) was the initial misdiagnosis but is ruled out by the lack of response to cloxacillin, the chronic indolent course (2 months), and negative bacterial cultures. Cutaneous tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterial infection could present similarly but are less likely to follow this specific lymphatic drainage pattern so rapidly without other signs. 4.

Clinical Anchor: The presentation of subacute meningitis with cranial nerve palsies and profound hypoglycorrhachia in a sarcoidosis patient is a 'red flag' for Cryptococcal infection. The **reactive latex agglutination test (Cryptococcal Antigen/CrAg)** in the CSF is the definitive immunologic anchor. 3. Differential Exclusion: Neurosarcoidosis is the primary distractor and a common misdiagnosis in this scenario, but it is a diagnosis of exclusion and would result in a negative fungal antigen test. Tuberculous meningitis is also a strong differential given the low glucose and basilar signs (CN palsies), but is ruled out by the specific positive fungal marker. 4.

",Cryptococcal Meningitis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an apparently immunocompetent older male, which makes the diagnosis challenging as this condition is classically associated with HIV or significant immunosuppression. However, growing literature (as highlighted in this case) recognizes it in individuals without overt immune deficits. 2. Clinical Anchor: The subacute presentation (9 days) of headache and 'B-symptoms' (night sweats) combined with a **lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis** in the CSF is the key anchor. This profile strongly points towards a fungal or tuberculous etiology over bacterial (neutrophilic) or viral (often less chronic/severe symptoms) causes. 3. Differential Exclusion: Viral meningitis is a common consideration given the lymphocytes, but the persistent/progressive nature and night sweats argue against it. Bacterial meningitis is ruled out by the subacute course and lack of neutrophilia. Tuberculous meningitis remains a differential but is less likely without specific exposure history or more severe inflammatory markers in this specific context (though it mimics this presentation). 4.

The rash initially appeared on his trunk and has since spread to his extremities. He also reports severe oral pain and dysuria. His medication history is significant for the recent initiation of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for opportunistic infection prophylaxis. Physical examination reveals coalescing vesiculobullous lesions on the chest and back. Application of lateral shearing force to the skin results in the detachment of the epidermis (positive Nikolsky sign). Significant mucosal ulcerations are observed in the oral cavity and at the urethral meatus. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a significant risk factor: a recent exposure to a high-risk medication (sulfonamide antibiotic) in the setting of HIV infection, which increases the likelihood of hypersensitivity reactions. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark presentation of severe mucositis (involving two distinct mucosal sites: oral and urethral) coupled with a blistering rash and a positive Nikolsky sign anchors the diagnosis to a severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) like SJS or TEN. 3. Differential Exclusion: Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS) causes skin detachment and a positive Nikolsky sign but typically spares the mucous membranes and is far more common in children; Erythema Multiforme is typically associated with HSV, has distinct targetoid lesions, and lacks the extensive epidermal detachment seen here. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed clinically by the specific morphology (mucocutaneous necrosis) and the temporal relationship to the offending drug, distinct from SJS/TEN overlap or TEN based on the extent of body surface area involved (typically <10% for SJS).",8,10,5

Three weeks ago, she received her first dose of pembrolizumab for a local tumor recurrence. Physical examination reveals diffuse erythema with extensive areas of skin detachment affecting approximately 50% of her body surface area, alongside severe ulceration of the oral mucosa. A skin biopsy demonstrates widespread keratinocyte necrosis of the epidermis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient was exposed to a new high-risk pharmacologic agent, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab), 3 weeks prior to presentation. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark presentation is the acute onset of severe mucositis (oral ulcers) combined with extensive skin detachment (positive Nikolsky sign implied by 'detachment'), which characterizes severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR). 3. Differential Exclusion: An exacerbation of her underlying Paraneoplastic Dermatomyositis is a key distractor; however, that would present with intensifying muscle weakness and pathognomonic rashes (heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules) rather than the generalized epidermal necrosis and detachment seen here. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the specific histopathological finding of keratinocyte necrosis and the temporal correlation with the immunotherapy infusion.",2,3,5

Two months prior, she was started on carbamazepine and phenytoin for new-onset seizures. Thirty-five days later, she developed a pruritic, red, purpuric rash on her face and upper torso, accompanied by high-grade fever, severe mucosal erosions of the eyes and mouth, and skin detachment involving approximately 23% of her body surface area. The antiepileptic medications were discontinued, but 20 days later, she became lethargic. On admission, she is tachypneic. Laboratory evaluation reveals a blood glucose of 23.8 mmol/L (428 mg/dL), significant ketonuria, and metabolic acidosis (pH 7.16) with an elevated anion gap. Her HbA1c is 7.0%, and fasting C-peptide is extremely low (8.79 pmol/L). Autoimmune antibodies (GAD, IA-2, ZnT8) are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Fulminant Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (secondary to SJS/TEN),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a recent history of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SJS/TEN overlap) triggered by high-risk antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine/phenytoin). While Fulminant T1DM is more common in East Asian populations, the key risk factor here is the preceding massive immune activation from the drug reaction. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with a *near-normal HbA1c* (7.0%) and absent C-peptide indicates rapid and complete beta-cell destruction, which is the hallmark of Fulminant Type 1 Diabetes. This distinguishes it from classic Type 1 (slower onset, higher HbA1c) or Type 2. 3. Differential Exclusion: Type 2 Diabetes presenting with Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) is a differential due to her age, but the presence of severe ketoacidosis and the extremely low C-peptide rule this out. Classic Type 1 Diabetes is excluded by the rapidity of onset (near-normal HbA1c implies hyperglycemia has been present for only days, not months). 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the criteria of: 1) DKA, 2) Plasma glucose ≥16.0 mmol/L with HbA1c < 8.7%, and 3) Fasting serum C-peptide < 0.10 nmol/L.

He reports spontaneous bleeding from his nose, mouth, and skin. On examination, he is confused. There are extensive maculopapular, vesicular, and target-like lesions covering the torso and extremities, including the palms and soles. Severe mucositis is evident, involving the lips, buccal mucosa, conjunctivae, and urethral meatus. Laboratory workup reveals leukopenia (WBC 3.4 × 10^3/µL), thrombocytopenia (51 × 10^3/µL), and elevated liver enzymes (AST 273 U/L, ALT 93 U/L). A CT scan of the chest shows 'tree-in-bud' and ground-glass opacities in the left upper lung. During his hospitalization, he develops acute left-sided weakness; MRI of the brain confirms a right frontal lobe infarct with hemorrhagic transformation. Testing for HIV, syphilis, and herpes viruses is negative. What is the most likely underlying etiology?",Mycoplasma pneumoniae-induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Stroke,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a previously healthy adult presenting with respiratory symptoms followed by severe mucocutaneous and neurological sequelae. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a well-known, though under-recognized, cause of extrapulmonary manifestations, particularly in younger adults. 2. Clinical Anchor: The triad of atypical pneumonia ('tree-in-bud' opacities), severe mucositis with targetoid skin lesions (SJS/atypical SJS), and an unexplained ischemic stroke in a young patient without cardiovascular risk factors strongly anchors to a systemic Mycoplasma infection. The 'mucocutaneous' presentation (SJS) is a key feature distinguishing it from standard bacterial pneumonias. 3. Differential Exclusion: Meningococcemia could cause rash and confusion but typically presents with purpura fulminans and rapid shock, not the specific targetoid/vesicular rash of SJS or the tree-in-bud pneumonia. Vasculitis (e.g., SLE) is a differential for multi-system involvement (stroke + rash + cytopenias) but infectious workup (positive respiratory panel for Mycoplasma mentioned in the source reasoning) and the specific pattern of mucositis prioritize the infectious etiology. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is unified by the positive M. pneumoniae serology/PCR, which accounts for the pulmonary infiltrates, the immune-mediated SJS (confirmed by biopsy showing epidermal necrosis), and the prothrombotic state leading to stroke.",8,8,5

He also reports a history of fever, chills, and hemoptysis during military service on Jeju Island, Korea, approximately 60 years ago. Neurologic examination reveals intact cranial nerves and no focal motor deficits; however, neuropsychological testing demonstrates deficits in word fluency, naming, and recall (Global Deterioration Scale 4). A contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain reveals encephalomalacia in the right temporo-occipital region accompanied by multiple calcifications and cystic lesions. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cerebral Paragonimiasis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a distinct geographic risk factor: military service in an endemic region (Jeju Island, Korea) with a history of consuming potentially undercooked crustaceans (implied by the locale) and subsequent hemoptysis. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of chronic epilepsy, a history of hemoptysis (suggesting primary pulmonary infection), and specific neuroimaging findings (calcified cystic lesions in the temporo-occipital lobes) creates a highly specific clinical picture for cerebral parasitic infection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Neurocysticercosis is the top differential for calcified brain cysts and seizures; however, the specific history of *hemoptysis* (lung involvement) preceding the neurological symptoms strongly favors Paragonimiasis (lung fluke) over Cysticercosis (pork tapeworm), which typically does not cause hemoptysis. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the strongly positive anti-Paragonimus specific IgG antibody (ELISA) and the characteristic 'soap bubble' or calcified cystic appearance on MRI in the context of the patient's long-standing history.",8,10,5

He reports first noticing a bean-sized nodule below his navel three months ago, which gradually migrated inferiorly to the current scrotal location. He denies fever, cough, night sweats, or urinary symptoms. Physical examination reveals a 1.5 cm × 1.0 cm, nontender, mobile, rubbery nodule located between the dartos layer and the tunica vaginalis; the testis itself is unremarkable. Routine laboratory studies, including urinalysis and tumor markers, are normal. Surgical excision of the mass reveals a gray, incompletely encapsulated nodule. Histopathological examination demonstrates a sinus tract with dense eosinophilic infiltration and the presence of Charcot–Leyden crystals. Upon further questioning, the patient admits to consuming uncooked river crabs several months prior. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Scrotal Paragonimiasis (Ectopic Paragonimiasis),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young adult with a specific dietary history of consuming uncooked freshwater crustaceans (river crabs), which serves as the intermediate host for the parasite. 2. Clinical Anchor: The key diagnostic features are the *migratory* nature of the subcutaneous nodule (moving from the abdomen to the scrotum) and the specific histopathology (eosinophilic abscesses with Charcot–Leyden crystals), which are hallmarks of a parasitic infection like *Paragonimus skriabini* (which causes cutaneous larva migrans). 3. Differential Exclusion: An epididymal tumor or testicular malignancy would be a primary concern but typically presents as a fixed mass without a history of migration and would lack the intense eosinophilic infiltrate on biopsy. Scrotal tuberculosis is a differential but was excluded by the absence of systemic symptoms and negative acid-fast staining; it also does not present as a migratory nodule. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the combination of the exposure history (raw crabs), the clinical presentation of a migratory eosinophilic granuloma, and the histological evidence of parasitic remnants (or their metabolic byproducts like crystals), necessitating treatment with Praziquantel.",8,10,5

Social history reveals he is a non-vegetarian and has consumed freshwater crabs and snails over the past three years. Initial workup reveals a pleural effusion with high protein and elevated LDH, but no organisms are identified; he is treated empirically for tuberculosis with transient improvement. Two years later, he returns with worsening symptoms and frank hemoptysis. A repeat HRCT of the chest demonstrates a small, irregular cavitary lesion (18 × 14 × 15 mm) in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, surrounded by ground-glass opacity and linear streaks extending to the pleura ('worm nodule'). Sputum analysis for acid-fast bacilli and GeneXpert are negative. A lobectomy is performed for suspected aspergillosis. Histopathological examination of the excised cavity reveals a parasitic structure with a thick cuticle, serous glands, and multiple foreign body granulomas containing refractile, oval-to-angulated ova. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Paragonimiasis (Pulmonary Paragonimiasis),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a specific dietary risk factor: the consumption of undercooked freshwater crustaceans (crabs/snails), which are the intermediate hosts for the parasite. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of chronic pulmonary symptoms (cough, hemoptysis) that mimic tuberculosis but fail to respond to anti-tubercular therapy is a classic presentation. The HRCT finding of a nodule with a linear track extending to the pleura is highly suggestive of a burrowing parasite. 3. Differential Exclusion: Tuberculosis is the primary distractor (and initial misdiagnosis) due to the cavitary lesion and effusion; however, the persistent negative AFB/GeneXpert and lack of sustained response to ATT rule it out. Aspergillosis (fungal ball) is another differential for a cavitary lesion but would typically show fungal hyphae, not the specific parasitic morphology (cuticle/suckers/ova) described on biopsy. 4.

Retrospective review of chest CT imaging from four months ago identifies linear opacities extending from the visceral pleura into the lung parenchyma of the bilateral upper lobes. Additionally, she has recently developed inflammatory changes in the subcutaneous tissue of the right buttock and a new hypodense lesion in the spleen. Stool and sputum examinations are negative for ova. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Paragonimiasis ,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a specific dietary exposure (consumption of wild game/deer stew) which serves as a paratenic host for the parasite. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark radiological sign of 'worm migration tracks' (linear opacities extending from the pleura) combined with the classic triad of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and significant eosinophilia strongly suggests a parasitic pulmonary infection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) could explain the eosinophilia and lung findings but typically presents with asthma and does not cause the specific migratory tracks or subcutaneous inflammatory nodules linked to dietary history. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by positive serological testing for Paragonimus antibodies, which is necessary when stool and sputum are negative for eggs (often the case in early or low-burden infections).",10,10,5

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the left lower lung field. Routine laboratory workup is notable for leukocytosis (8,930/μL) with significant eosinophilia (13%; absolute count 1,198/μL). A chest radiograph demonstrates a heterogeneous, cavitated nodule in the left hemithorax. A subsequent CT scan confirms a 2.6 x 3 cm thick-walled cavitary lesion in the lingula with fibrous tracts extending toward the visceral pleura . Further history taking reveals the patient regularly consumes raw freshwater crabs and shrimp. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Paragonimiasis (Pulmonary Paragonimiasis),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in an endemic region (Peruvian Amazon/San Martín) and has a specific dietary risk factor: the chronic consumption of raw freshwater crustaceans (crabs/shrimp), which are the intermediate hosts for *Paragonimus* species. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of chronic hemoptysis, fever, and a cavitary lung lesion that is unresponsive to empiric tuberculosis treatment is the classic 'mimic' presentation. The presence of significant peripheral eosinophilia (13%) strongly points toward a parasitic etiology rather than a bacterial (TB) or fungal one. 3. Differential Exclusion: Pulmonary Tuberculosis is the primary differential due to the endemicity and cavitary presentation; however, it is excluded by the persistent negative AFB smears, GeneXpert, and lack of response to prolonged ATT. Aspergillosis is unlikely given the patient's immunocompetent status and the specific radiological finding of fibrous tracts (worm migration tracks) rather than a fungal ball. 4.

Sensory examination shows a sensory level below T6 on the right and T8 on the left. MRI of the head demonstrates multiple abnormal signals in the semioval centers and pons, while cervical MRI shows increased T2 signal intensity within the spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals pleocytosis and elevated protein. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Neurobrucellosis (Brucellar Myelitis),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a farmer with a history of direct contact with livestock (sheep), which is the primary risk factor for Brucellosis. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a chronic/recurrent febrile illness followed by specific neurological deficits (myelitis features: paraparesis, sensory level, sphincter dysfunction) and cranial nerve involvement (dysarthria/tongue deviation) anchors to Neurobrucellosis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Multiple Sclerosis is a differential for multifocal white matter lesions and myelitis; however, the patient's occupational exposure, systemic prodrome (fever/sweats), and the specific CSF findings (infectious profile) make an infectious etiology more likely. Tuberculosis of the spine (Pott's disease) could cause myelopathy but typically presents with destructive vertebral bone lesions rather than the demyelinating-like patterns seen here. 4.

This is the primary vector for transmission. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation combines systemic constitutional symptoms (fever, night sweats, leukopenia) with specific right upper quadrant pathology (thick-walled, acalculous gallbladder). This 'systemic infection + localized cholecystitis' pattern is a rare but documented presentation of Brucellosis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Typhoid fever (Salmonella) can cause acalculous cholecystitis and leukopenia but typically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms early on and positive blood/stool cultures, which were negative here.

Laboratory evaluation reveals leukocytosis (8,120/μL with 77% neutrophils) and elevated CRP (13.66 mg/dL). Extensive workup for HIV, Tuberculosis (T-Spot), and autoimmune etiologies is negative. Blood cultures are sterile. However, a specific agglutination test reveals a titer of 1:160 against a specific zoonotic pathogen. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chronic Brucellosis (specifically Brucella canis),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a specific occupational/educational risk factor: attending an animal care school and assisting in dog deliveries 19 years prior, as well as continued dog ownership. This points towards a zoonotic source, specifically one associated with canines (*Brucella canis*). 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark presentation is 'undulant fever'—a fever pattern that comes and goes over a very long period (chronic nature)—combined with nonspecific symptoms like malaise, arthralgia, and history of lymphadenopathy. The history of transient neurological symptoms (paralysis) is also a known (though rarer) complication of neurobrucellosis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Tuberculosis is a strong differential for chronic fever and lymphadenopathy, but the T-Spot was negative. Lymphoma is considered due to lymphadenopathy, but the spontaneous resolution of nodes and long duration (19 years) makes malignancy unlikely. Autoimmune diseases (SLE, Vasculitis) were excluded by negative ANA/ANCA. 4.

Urinalysis and urine cultures are negative, and a Doppler ultrasound of the renal graft shows preserved vascularity with no evidence of rejection. Despite four days of empiric treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam, his fever persists. Subsequently, blood cultures isolate a slow-growing Gram-negative coccobacillus, and immunocapture assay reveals an agglutination titer of 1:10,240. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Brucellosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a solid organ transplant recipient (immunocompromised) living in Saudi Arabia, a region where this zoonotic infection is endemic. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in a transplant patient, combined with the specific microbiological finding of a 'Gram-negative coccobacillus' and an extremely high agglutination titer (1:10,240), anchors the diagnosis. 3.

Breath sounds are decreased on the right side. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates pancytopenia (Hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL, WBC 5,500/mm³, Platelets 79,000/mm³) and hypoalbuminemia. Imaging confirms hepatosplenomegaly, mild ascites, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a right-sided pleural effusion. Thoracentesis reveals a lymphocytic exudate with no malignant cells or acid-fast bacilli. During her hospitalization, she develops an acute episode of agitation and delirium; a subsequent MRI of the brain shows minimal meningeal enhancement along the right parietal lobe. Autoimmune and tuberculosis workups are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Brucellosis (specifically Neurobrucellosis),"1.

He previously took a course of oral albendazole and ivermectin, which stopped the migratory nodules but did not resolve the facial lesion. Physical examination reveals a solitary, well-defined, non-tender 2 × 2 cm subcutaneous nodule overlying the right mandible. A midnight peripheral blood smear is negative for microfilariae. Ultrasonography of the nodule demonstrates a cystic area containing linear echogenic structures exhibiting a chaotic, random movement pattern. What is the most likely diagnosis?
",Extralymphatic Filariasis (caused by Wuchereria bancrofti),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in India, a region endemic for filariasis. The history of transient, migratory swellings mimics 'Calabar swellings' seen in Loiasis, but the geographic setting (India vs. Africa) strongly favors Wuchereria or Brugia species. 2.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen identifies a large (29 cm × 28 cm) retroperitoneal cystic lesion with multiple thin septations, initially raising suspicion for a mesenteric cyst. Due to the mass effect, he undergoes an exploratory laparotomy with complete surgical excision. Gross examination shows a thin-walled, transparent cyst containing hemorrhagic fluid.

Clinical Anchor: While filariasis typically presents with hydrocele or lymphedema, this case highlights a rare ectopic presentation: a large **retroperitoneal cyst**. The key diagnostic anchor is the identification of **microfilariae** in the cyst fluid and adult worm remnants in the cyst wall. 3.

",Zoonotic Lymphatic Filariasis (caused by Brugia species),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a child with **no travel history** outside the US (Massachusetts), presenting with a condition typically endemic to the tropics. This strongly suggests a **zoonotic** infection acquired locally rather than classic human filariasis (*Wuchereria*). Zoonotic *Brugia* species (e.g., *Brugia beaveri*) are known to infect incidental human hosts in North America, often transmitted by mosquitoes from reservoirs like raccoons or bobcats. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a solitary, chronic, non-tender cervical lymph node in a non-traveler is the hallmark of North American zoonotic filariasis. Unlike tropical filariasis, it rarely causes lymphedema or microfilaremia. 3. Differential Exclusion: Lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's) is a primary concern for persistent cervical adenopathy but is ruled out by the histologic finding of a nematode. Cat Scratch Disease usually presents with tender adenopathy and a history of cat contact/scratch. *Wuchereria bancrofti* is excluded by the lack of travel to endemic tropical regions. 4.

Physical examination reveals grade IV muscle strength, increased muscle tension, a positive Babinski sign, and ankle clonus in the left lower extremity. Initial blood work shows peripheral eosinophilia (6% eosinophils). An initial MRI from an outside hospital demonstrated multiple irregular ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontoparietal lobe and the splenium of the corpus callosum. Upon further questioning, the guardians report the child had consumed raw frog meat. Subsequent serological and CSF testing reveals positive IgG and IgM antibodies for a specific parasite. Follow-up MRIs over two months show migration of the lesions from the right frontoparietal cortex, through the splenium, into the right lateral ventricle choroid plexus, and finally into the deep white matter of the right occipital lobe.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young child from rural China with a specific dietary history of consuming raw frog meat, a known intermediate host for *Spirometra* larvae. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of migrating neurological deficits (paralysis), peripheral eosinophilia, and the characteristic 'wandering' lesions on MRI (migration from one lobe to another, or through the corpus callosum) is highly suggestive. The 'ring-enhancing' lesions seen on MRI are classic for granulomatous inflammation around the larva. 3. Differential Exclusion: While neurocysticercosis is a common parasitic brain infection, it typically presents with calcified or cystic lesions and is associated with pork tapeworm (*Taenia solium*). Tuberculoma and brain tumors (like glioma) would present as mass lesions but lack the rapid, distinct migratory pattern observed in this case (moving between lobes and through the ventricle over weeks). 4.

A metastatic workup is unrevealing except for a small subcutaneous nodule on the left thigh. Over the next seven months, the intracranial lesion slowly enlarges. A biopsy of the thigh nodule initially suggests cysticercosis, but treatment with albendazole and praziquantel fails to resolve symptoms or significantly reduce the brain lesion size. A second biopsy of a new nodule on the contralateral thigh reveals a 1.5 cm motile, white, ribbon-shaped worm. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cerebral Sparganosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from an endemic region (Southeast Asia), although the latency (30 years) is long, which is characteristic of this parasite (can persist for decades). 2. Clinical Anchor: The key anchors are the 'migrating' or 'wandering' nature of the lesions (new nodules appearing on different thighs), the failure of standard neurocysticercosis treatment, and the definitive gross pathology of a motile, ribbon-shaped worm extracted from a subcutaneous nodule. 3. Differential Exclusion: Neurocysticercosis is the primary differential due to the imaging (enhancing nodule) and initial biopsy interpretation; however, it is excluded by the negative serology, lack of response to albendazole, and the distinct morphology of the extracted worm (ribbon-like plerocercoid vs. cyst). Malignancy (glioma/metastasis) was ruled out by the migratory nature and biopsy findings. 4.

Clinical Anchor: The specific neuroimaging finding of **multiple conglomerate cysts ('clusters of grapes') in the basal cisterns** without visible scolices is pathognomonic for the **racemose** form of neurocysticercosis. This form differs from the parenchymal form by the aberrant proliferation of cyst membranes in the subarachnoid space. 3.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from a malaria-endemic region (Liberia) but presents with a 'black swan' timeline: symptom onset 7 years after leaving the endemic zone without re-exposure. This challenges the standard incubation period heuristic. 2. Clinical Anchor: The classic triad of fever, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia (indirect hyperbilirubinemia) paired with splenomegaly strongly suggests malaria. The pathognomonic anchor is the visualization of intraerythrocytic ring forms on the blood smear. 3. Differential Exclusion: Babesiosis is a strong differential for ring forms on a smear in the US, but the patient explicitly denies outdoor activities (hiking/tick exposure), making it less likely. Leukemia could explain pancytopenia and splenomegaly but would not present with ringed trophozoites. 4. Confirmation: PCR testing confirms Plasmodium falciparum, identifying this as an exceptionally rare case of prolonged dormancy (recrudescence) or delayed presentation, likely due to immune evasion (antigenic variation) rather than the liver hypnozoites seen in P. vivax/ovale.",8,10,5

Post-malaria neurological syndrome (PMNS) is a consideration but typically presents after clearance of parasitemia as a self-limiting ataxia or psychosis, rarely as NCSE, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of P. falciparum DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (via metagenomic NGS) despite negative peripheral blood smears.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient presents with hepatolithiasis (intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct stones), which is a significant risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma due to chronic inflammation. 2. Clinical Anchor: The diagnosis is anchored by the specific immunohistochemical profile showing co-expression of epithelial markers (CK-pan, CK8) and mesenchymal markers (vimentin) in a liver mass. This biphasic pattern (carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements) is pathognomonic for a sarcomatoid variant. 3. Differential Exclusion: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary differential given the arterial enhancement on CT; however, it is effectively excluded by the normal AFP level and the negative HepPar-1 staining. Standard adenocarcinoma of the bile duct is less likely given the prominent spindle cell component and vimentin positivity. 4. Confirmation: The final diagnosis is confirmed by the histologic presence of both epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation within the tumor, establishing it as a sarcomatoid intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (S-iCCA), a rare and aggressive variant associated with a poor prognosis.",10,10,5
184, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6157500/ ,"An elderly male presents to the emergency department after sustaining a fall with head trauma. A CT scan of the head reveals a 35 mm left parieto-occipital mass with significant perilesional edema, suggestive of metastasis. His medical history includes hypertension, heavy smoking, and inactive Hepatitis B. Laboratory evaluation shows normal liver enzymes and bilirubin, but Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is markedly elevated at 1753 ng/mL. CEA and CA 19-9 levels are within normal limits. An abdominal CT scan identifies a large (10 × 8 cm) heterogeneous, hypodense mass in the right hepatic lobe that exhibits peripheral enhancement in the arterial phase and progressive centripetal enhancement in the portal and delayed phases. A core needle biopsy of the liver mass reveals a malignant neoplasm with a biphasic appearance, containing both carcinomatous elements and pleomorphic spindle cells. Immunohistochemical staining is strongly positive for Cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and Vimentin, but negative for HepPar-1 and Cytokeratin 20 (CK20). What is the most likely diagnosis?",Intrahepatic Sarcomatoid Cholangiocarcinoma,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an elderly male with a history of inactive Hepatitis B, a known risk factor for primary liver malignancies. The presentation is aggressive, with distant metastasis (brain) at the time of diagnosis. 2. Clinical Anchor: The key diagnostic feature is the specific immunohistochemical profile: CK7 positivity indicates a biliary epithelial origin, while Vimentin positivity in the presence of spindle cells  indicates sarcomatous differentiation (epithelial-mesenchymal transition). 3. Differential Exclusion: Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the primary differential diagnosis given the significantly elevated AFP and Hepatitis B history; however, the negative HepPar-1 staining and the centripetal enhancement pattern (rather than arterial washout) effectively exclude HCC. Metastatic adenocarcinoma from the colon is excluded by the negative CK20. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the combination of biliary morphology (CK7+) and sarcomatoid features (Vimentin+, spindle cells) in the absence of hepatocellular markers, defining this rare and aggressive variant of cholangiocarcinoma.",10,10,5
185, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8849266/ ,"A 26-year-old male presents with insidious right upper quadrant abdominal pain, back pain, and unintentional weight loss. He is a non-smoker and denies alcohol consumption. As his condition progresses, he develops shortness of breath. An electrocardiogram reveals Q-waves, prompting an echocardiogram that identifies a compressive mass effect. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen demonstrates a massive, 21 × 19 cm heterogeneous intrahepatic mass within the right lobe, featuring central cystic lacunae and compression of the intrahepatic inferior vena cava. A core needle biopsy reveals tumor cells with uniform nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and eosinophilic cytoplasm organized in a cribriform pattern. Immunohistochemical staining is strongly positive for CK7 and inhibin, and shows patchy positivity for synaptophysin and CD56. Staining for HepPar-1 and germ cell markers is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cholangioblastic Variant of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young adult (20s-30s) presenting with a large, solitary hepatic mass, a demographic profile distinct from the typical older population associated with classic cholangiocarcinoma, but characteristic of this rare variant. 2. Clinical Anchor: The pathognomonic feature is the unique immunohistochemical profile: strong expression of inhibin in a primary liver tumor that morphologically mimics a neuroendocrine tumor (cribriform architecture, uniform nuclei). 3. Differential Exclusion: The primary differential is a Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET) given the morphology and expression of neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin, CD56); however, NETs generally do not express inhibin. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (fibrolamellar or classic) is excluded by the negative HepPar-1 staining. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the specific combination of biliary lineage (CK7 positive) and the aberrant, strong expression of inhibin, which defines the cholangioblastic variant.",10,10,5

Two weeks prior, he was evaluated for similar complaints and treated with amoxicillin and delousing shampoo for suspected cellulitis and lice, with no clinical improvement. The patient reports intermittent pain, pruritus, and a sensation of movement within the lesions. His medical history is significant for travel to Ecuador one month ago, where he had known mosquito exposure. Physical examination reveals six raised, indurated, and tender nodules on the scalp, the largest measuring 3 cm. Each lesion features a central pore with a visible, pulsating fluid level. Bedside point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) demonstrates hyperechoic foreign bodies within the subcutaneous tissue, surrounded by anechoic rings and posterior acoustic shadowing. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Furuncular Myiasis (Dermatobia hominis infestation),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a specific travel history to Ecuador (Central/South America), which is endemic for Dermatobia hominis (the human botfly) . The history of mosquito exposure is critical, as the botfly uses mosquitoes as a vector to deposit eggs on the host. 2. Clinical Anchor: The pathognomonic physical exam finding is a furuncular lesion with a central pore through which a pulsating fluid level or the spiracles of the larva can be visualized . This 'bubbling' or sensation of movement is highly specific. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial cellulitis or fungal kerion would present with inflammation but lack the discrete, mobile foreign body seen on POCUS. Epidermal inclusion cysts or pilomatricomas are static and do not exhibit the pulsatile nature or central breathing pore characteristic of a living larva. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the ultrasound appearance of an ovoid, hyperechoic foreign body with internal movement and subsequent extraction of the larvae.",10,10,5

The parents report that the lesions appeared five days after a family trip to Al-Shafa in the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia, where the child played in the soil. The mother notes the presence of many mosquitoes during the trip. The lesions began as small red bumps that have gradually increased in size and become solid. The infant has been irritable, crying frequently, and experiencing difficulty sleeping and decreased appetite, but has had no fever. The mother reports observing a 'tail' protruding from the center of the lesions. On physical examination, the patient is afebrile and vitally stable. Examination of the left hand reveals a warm, tender, erythematous swelling on the dorsal aspect of the first web space, characterized by a distinct papule with a central punctum . Similar lesions are noted on the scalp. Laboratory investigations show white blood cell counts and inflammatory markers within normal limits. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Furuncular Myiasis (Dermatobia hominis infestation),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a history of recent travel to a rural, subtropical region (Al-Shafa, Saudi Arabia) with exposure to soil and mosquitoes, which are key vectors for the transport of botfly eggs to human hosts. 2. Clinical Anchor: The pathognomonic presentation is the furuncular lesion with a central pore (punctum) through which the posterior spiracles (breathing tubes) of the larva can be visualized or 'wriggling' movement observed. 3. Differential Exclusion: A bacterial abscess or furuncle is the primary differential; however, the absence of fever, leukocytosis, and purulence, combined with the visible movement within the central pore, excludes a simple bacterial etiology. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the surgical extraction of the larvae using a punch biopsy tool and subsequent histopathological identification of the organism as Dermatobia hominis.",1,2,5

She resides in a single-room home with poor sanitation and open garbage nearby. She denies any history of trauma or known insect bites. Physical examination reveals multiple tender, erythematous, edematous nodules with central ulceration. On closer inspection, a white, motile structure is observed protruding from the central pore of the lesions. There is no purulent discharge, but the lesions are tender to palpation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Furuncular Myiasis (due to Cordylobia anthropophaga),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia), which is the endemic region for the Tumbu fly (Cordylobia anthropophaga). Poor sanitation and the presence of garbage are risk factors, as female flies often lay eggs on urine-soaked soil or damp clothing drying outside. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of multiple furuncular (boil-like) lesions with a central punctum containing a visible, protruding larva (specifically the posterior spiracles used for breathing) is pathognomonic for furuncular myiasis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Dermatobia hominis (Human Botfly) causes clinically identical lesions but is strictly endemic to Central and South America; since this patient is in East Africa, D. hominis is excluded. Bacterial furunculosis is a differential but is ruled out by the presence of a macroscopic, motile organism within the pore. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the manual extraction of the larvae, which allows for morphologic identification of Cordylobia anthropophaga , confirming the specific etiology of the infestation.",10,10,5

He has no history of trauma or known insect bites, but his mother notes that the family's clothes are typically washed in a nearby lagoon and air-dried outdoors on a line. Physical examination reveals a distinct, erythematous, boil-like nodule on the left side of the glans penis. A central punctum is visible, containing a whitish, mobile structure that retracts when touched. Systemic examination is unremarkable, and routine blood tests including a complete blood count are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Furuncular Myiasis (Cordylobia anthropophaga),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in West Africa (Nigeria), an endemic region for *Cordylobia anthropophaga* (Tumbu fly). The history of air-drying clothes outdoors is a classic risk factor, as female flies lay eggs on damp cloth or soil, which then hatch and penetrate the skin upon contact. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a furuncle-like nodule on the glans penis with a central pore (punctum) containing a visible, mobile white structure  and the subjective sensation of movement is pathognomonic for furuncular myiasis. 3. Differential Exclusion: A bacterial furuncle or abscess is the primary differential but typically presents with fluctuance and purulence without the characteristic central breathing pore or internal movement. STIs like a chancre are unlikely given the patient's age and the clear presence of a motile organism. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the occlusion of the pore (e.g., with petroleum jelly) to induce the larva's emergence for air, followed by extraction and morphological identification of the Tumbu fly larva.",10,10,5

She reports a history of trekking in the Amazon forests of Brazil one month prior, where she recalls a possible insect bite. Physical examination reveals a red, inflamed, elevated nodule with a distinct central punctum. Ultrasound imaging demonstrates an oblong hypoechoic mass within the subcutaneous tissue containing a hyperechoic core with posterior acoustic shadowing. When the central pore is occluded with ultrasound gel, internal fluid circulation and movement are observed within the mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Furuncular Myiasis (Dermatobia hominis),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a clear travel history to the Amazon region of South America, which is endemic for Dermatobia hominis (the human botfly), an obligatory parasite that infests mammals. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of a furuncular lesion with a central pore and the specific sonographic finding of the 'bubbling sign' —where occlusion of the pore causes larval asphyxiation and visible hyperactive movement—is pathognomonic for a live larva. 3. Differential Exclusion: An infected sebaceous cyst or bacterial furuncle is the primary differential diagnosis; however, these would appear as static fluid collections on ultrasound and would not demonstrate the internal motility or 'bubbling' phenomenon seen in this case. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is definitively confirmed by the surgical excision of the second-instar larva, which is identified morphologically by its rows of caudally pointing spines.",10,10,5

Initial evaluation reveals Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Due to the risk of preterm delivery, she receives a course of antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity and is discharged. She returns 4 days later with worsening emesis, tachycardia, and a new pericardial effusion. Her course is complicated by placental abruption requiring emergent cesarean section. Postoperatively, she develops profound septic shock with fever, leukocytosis, and lactic acidosis. CT pulmonary angiography reveals diffuse ground-glass nodules, while abdominal imaging shows significant thickening of the small bowel and cecal walls. Blood cultures grow Escherichia coli. Cytological examination of a sputum sample and a wet mount of stool both reveal the presence of motile larvae. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient originates from Honduras, a region endemic for soil-transmitted helminths. The critical risk factor is the administration of high-dose antenatal corticosteroids, which triggers the transformation of chronic asymptomatic carriage into fulminant disease. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark of this syndrome is the 'autoinfection' cycle accelerated by immunosuppression (steroids), leading to massive larval migration. This presents clinically as gram-negative sepsis (due to larvae carrying gut bacteria like E. coli into the blood) combined with pulmonary symptoms (pneumonitis/ground-glass opacities) as larvae migrate through the alveoli . 3. Differential Exclusion: Ascaris lumbricoides can cause pneumonitis (Löffler syndrome) but typically does not cause the severe sepsis or disseminated multi-organ failure seen here, nor is it triggered by steroids to this degree. Bacterial sepsis alone explains the shock but not the presence of larvae in the sputum. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of rhabditiform (or filariform) larvae in extra-intestinal sites, specifically the sputum, which is pathognomonic for the hyperinfection phase.",10,10,5

He has a 2-month history of recurrent fever and productive cough, for which he was treated multiple times for community-acquired pneumonia without resolution. He also reports a brief admission two weeks prior for new-onset seizures. Physical examination reveals a distended, tender abdomen and nuchal rigidity. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrates a marked neutrophilic pleocytosis (1,300 cells/µL) with low glucose and high protein. Laboratory review notes a current peripheral eosinophil count of 0.05 × 10^9/L, a significant decline from a count of 2.46 × 10^9/L recorded one month prior. Stool microscopy reveals motile rhabditiform larvae. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient originates from Southeast Asia, a region with high endemicity for Strongyloides stercoralis. This geographic background suggests the potential for chronic asymptomatic carriage (autoinfection) which can persist for decades. 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical picture involves failure of multiple organ systems—Respiratory (recurrent pneumonia), Gastrointestinal (severe colitis/distension), and Central Nervous System (meningitis/seizures). The critical diagnostic clue is the 'eosinophilic exhaustion': a shift from marked eosinophilia (during the chronic phase) to eosinopenia (during the acute hyperinfection phase), often due to bacterial superinfection or immune suppression. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial meningitis is the primary differential given the neutrophilic CSF; however, it does not explain the antecedent eosinophilia, the recurrent pulmonary symptoms, or the severe enteritis. Angiostrongyliasis typically presents with eosinophilic, not neutrophilic, meningitis. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the visualization of Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in the stool and the detection of parasitic DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, indicating massive larval migration from the gut to the CNS.",10,10,5

On postoperative day 8, she develops septic shock with fevers to 39.4°C and tachycardia. Blood cultures are positive for Escherichia coli. A CT pulmonary angiogram reveals diffuse ground-glass opacities suggestive of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Induced sputum analysis demonstrates the presence of nematode larvae. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from an endemic region (Nicaragua), implicating chronic autoinfection. The administration of corticosteroids (even a single dose) acts as the critical trigger for the transformation of the parasite life cycle, precipitating hyperinfection. 2. Clinical Anchor: The triad of gastrointestinal dysfunction (ileus, protein-losing enteropathy), pulmonary symptoms (pneumonitis/hemorrhage), and gram-negative bacteremia (sepsis caused by enteric organisms carried by migrating larvae) is pathognomonic for Strongyloides hyperinfection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial aspiration pneumonia is a differential for the respiratory failure and fever, especially post-anesthesia; however, it does not explain the gram-negative bacteremia without a distinct source or the presence of larvae in the sputum. 4.

Serum cortisol levels are within normal limits. Stool microscopy for ova and parasites is negative. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is performed to investigate persistent vomiting, revealing patchy erythema and erosions in the duodenal mucosa. Biopsy of the affected mucosa shows inflammatory infiltrates with numerous parasitic forms embedded within the crypts. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from an endemic region (India) and has a critical risk factor: chronic high-dose corticosteroid therapy . This immunosuppression disrupts the Th2 response, allowing the parasite to shift from a chronic autoinfection state to uncontrolled proliferation (hyperinfection). 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of unexplained protein-losing enteropathy (hypoproteinemia, pedal edema) and severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms in a patient on long-term steroids is highly suggestive. The 'negative' stool exam is a classic distractor in hyperinfection, as larvae may be sequestered in the gut wall or lungs, or output may be intermittent. 3. Differential Exclusion: Steroid-induced gastritis is a primary consideration given the medication history and symptoms; however, it does not explain the severe protein-losing enteropathy or the presence of organisms on biopsy.

Laboratory evaluation shows mild anemia, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytosis; peripheral eosinophil counts are within normal limits. Serologic testing is reactive for HTLV-I/II antibodies. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrates proximal dilatation of the stomach and duodenum with abrupt tapering at the third portion of the duodenum, consistent with gastric outlet obstruction. Upper endoscopy reveals congested, ulcerated, and erythematous mucosa with significant narrowing in the third portion of the duodenum. Biopsies are taken from the inflamed mucosa. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient originates from the Caribbean (Jamaica), an endemic region for *Strongyloides stercoralis*, and has a specific coinfection with HTLV-1. HTLV-1 drives a Th1-predominant immune response, suppressing the Th2 response necessary to control the parasite, thus facilitating massive proliferation (hyperinfection). 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) symptoms (vomiting, profound weight loss) caused by severe duodenal inflammation (duodenitis) in an HTLV-1 positive patient is a specific, albeit rare, manifestation of high parasitic burden in the proximal small intestine. 3. Differential Exclusion: Gastrointestinal malignancy (e.g., pancreatic or duodenal adenocarcinoma) is the leading differential for GOO with cachexia in an elderly patient; however, the endoscopic appearance of diffuse inflammation/ulceration rather than a discrete mass, combined with the specific risk factor of HTLV-1, points away from cancer. 4.

Physical examination reveals a single 4 x 5 cm firm, painless, verrucous plaque with irregular borders and a scaly, violaceous surface. There is no palpable regional lymphadenopathy. A punch biopsy is performed, and histopathological analysis demonstrates granulomatous inflammation with abundant multinucleated giant cells. Giemsa staining of the tissue reveals the presence of intracellular amastigotes within histiocytes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Atypical Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (Verrucous Variant),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient lives and works in an endemic region (Pacific coast of Ecuador, rural forest environment) with high exposure to sandfly vectors. Additionally, his use of azathioprine for ulcerative colitis creates an immunocompromised state, which is a known risk factor for developing atypical clinical presentations of this infection. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of a chronic, painless 'verrucous plaque' (mimicking warts or malignancy) in an endemic zone, combined with the specific histological finding of intracellular amastigotes (Leishman-Donovan bodies), anchors the diagnosis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Chromoblastomycosis is a strong differential diagnosis given the verrucous morphology and similar geographic distribution; however, it is excluded by the biopsy findings, which would demonstrate muriform (sclerotic) bodies ('copper pennies') rather than intracellular amastigotes. 4.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is pregnant, a state characterized by a physiologic shift toward T-helper 2 (Th2) immunity. This relative cell-mediated immunosuppression is a key risk factor for developing 'exuberant' or atypical phenotypes of intracellular parasitic infections. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of rapidly progressive, large, disfiguring, and ulcerative facial plaques (an exuberant phenotype) specifically during pregnancy is a high-yield clinical anchor for complex cutaneous leishmaniasis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Pyoderma Gangrenosum is a leading differential for rapid ulcerative skin lesions; however, it typically presents with intense pain and undermined violet borders, and lacks the specific 'exuberant' vegetative quality seen in this parasitic variant. 4.

His parents report that he has never received childhood vaccinations. On physical examination, the patient is anxious and diaphoretic with tachycardia (110 bpm). He exhibits marked trismus, a fixed grimace (risus sardonicus), and board-like rigidity of the abdominal muscles. During the exam, a tactile stimulus triggers a painful, generalized tonic muscle spasm.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Generalized Tetanus,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an unimmunized adolescent with a history of a puncture wound involving rusty/iron material 10 days prior, which corresponds to the typical incubation period (3-21 days) for Clostridium tetani spores to germinate. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is defined by the classic triad of trismus (lockjaw), risus sardonicus (sustained spasm of facial muscles), and generalized tetanic spasms triggered by stimuli. 3. Differential Exclusion: Dystonic reaction (e.g., to metoclopramide or phenothiazines) is a differential but is ruled out by the lack of medication history and the presence of the traumatic wound. Hypocalcemic tetany is excluded by the normal serum calcium and magnesium levels. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by the progression of descending muscle rigidity (starting with the jaw/throat) and autonomic instability (tachycardia/diaphoresis) in the absence of vaccination.",10,10,5

One week prior, he sustained a laceration to his right knee from a disc grinder while working; the wound was sutured at a local clinic and treated with oral amoxicillin. He has no known chronic medical conditions or allergies. His vaccination history is incomplete, with the last tetanus booster date unknown. On physical examination, he is afebrile (36.9°C) but hypertensive (130/85 mmHg) and tachycardic (96 bpm). Neurologic exam reveals significant trismus, risus sardonicus (sustained spasm of facial muscles), and neck rigidity. The abdominal muscles are rigid on palpation. Examination of the right knee reveals a sutured wound with seropurulent discharge, erythema, and tenderness. During the evaluation, the patient exhibits generalized, painful muscle spasms involving back arching (opisthotonos). A chest X-ray and head CT are unremarkable. Laboratory results show leukocytosis (11,530/µL) with neutrophilia. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Generalized Tetanus,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an older adult from a rural setting with an unknown/incomplete vaccination status. He has a specific high-risk injury (disc grinder laceration) that occurred 7 days prior, falling within the typical incubation period (3-21 days) for Clostridium tetani. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is classic for generalized tetanus: the triad of trismus (lockjaw), risus sardonicus (facial spasm), and opisthotonos (back arching/spasms) triggered by a contaminated wound. 3. Differential Exclusion: Strychnine poisoning can cause similar spasms but lacks the history of a dirty wound and typically presents with rapid onset after ingestion. Dystonic reactions to medications (e.g., neuroleptics) are ruled out by the absence of relevant medication history. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is clinical, supported by the progression of descending muscle rigidity and spasms following a specific injury prone to anaerobic infection.

She is 18 days postpartum following a vaginal delivery complicated by postpartum hemorrhage requiring uterine curettage for retained placental tissue. Her medical history includes two prior uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. Vaccination records indicate she received three doses of DTaP in childhood and a Tdap booster during each pregnancy, including one administered at 27 weeks gestation in the most recent pregnancy. Two days prior to the current presentation, she was treated at a local facility for fever, headache, and malaise with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection and severe anemia (hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL). On admission to the ICU, she is obtunded (GCS 7) with marked nuchal rigidity and limb stiffness. Initial lumbar puncture and non-contrast head CT are unremarkable. By hospital day 2, she develops severe trismus, apneic spells, and generalized spasms of the trunk and extremities triggered by passive motion. Vital signs demonstrate tachycardia and fluctuating blood pressure. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Obstetric Tetanus (despite immunization),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is in the postpartum period (puerperium) and underwent an invasive obstetric procedure (uterine curettage), which is a known portal of entry for *Clostridium tetani*, particularly in resource-limited settings. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from nonspecific symptoms to the classic triad of trismus, nuchal rigidity, and generalized reflex spasms (triggered by passive motion) is pathognomonic for severe generalized tetanus. The autonomic instability (fluctuating BP/HR) further supports this. 3. Differential Exclusion: Eclampsia is unlikely given the timing (18 days postpartum is late) and the specific nature of the spasms (tonic/reflexive rather than tonic-clonic seizures). Bacterial meningitis is ruled out by the normal CSF findings (low white cell count, normal glucose/protein) and negative cultures. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is clinical, based on the specific constellation of muscular rigidity and spasms in a postpartum patient. The key \""distractor\"" or unique feature here is the documented full immunization history, making this an extremely rare case of vaccine failure or non-protective antibody response, but the clinical phenotype remains definitive for obstetric tetanus.",10,10,5

Her parents report that she has received no routine childhood immunizations. On examination, the abdomen is distended and rigid with diffuse tenderness. Due to concern for a surgical emergency, she undergoes an exploratory laparotomy, which reveals enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes but no appendicitis or perforation. On the sixth day of hospitalization, her condition evolves; she becomes lethargic and develops profound nuchal rigidity, 'lockjaw,' and severe, spontaneous arching of the back (opisthotonos). A meticulous re-examination of her skin reveals a small, healed puncture wound on the sole of her foot. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Generalized Tetanus,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an unvaccinated child, which is the single most significant risk factor for tetanus in the pediatric population. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation highlights a classic 'mimic': abdominal rigidity caused by truncal muscle spasms often leads to a misdiagnosis of 'acute abdomen' (hence the negative laparotomy). The definitive anchor appears post-operatively with the onset of trismus and opisthotonos —the hallmark sign of severe tetanus involving the paraspinal muscles. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial meningitis could cause fever and nuchal rigidity, but it typically does not cause the sustained, board-like abdominal rigidity or the violent, arching spasms triggered by stimuli seen in tetanus. Acute appendicitis was effectively ruled out by the surgery. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by the constellation of muscle spasms and rigidity in an unimmunized host with a potential portal of entry (foot puncture), caused by the neurotoxin tetanospasmin.",10,10,5

A few hours after admission, he develops escalating muscle spasms originating in the abdomen and progressing to generalized posturing with hyperextension of the head, neck, and spine. He also exhibits trismus. The parents report similar 'back-arching' episodes at home over the last few days precipitated by abdominal pain. Social history reveals the family lives in a rural area, participates in a community that declines vaccination, and the child frequently walks barefoot outdoors near farm animals. There is no specific history of a recent puncture wound. Extensive workup including lumbar puncture, brain MRI, and encephalopathy panels are unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Generalized Tetanus,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an unvaccinated child living in a rural environment with exposure to soil and farm animals (Clostridium tetani spores), which is the primary risk factor. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of abdominal rigidity (often mistaken for acute abdomen) progressing to opisthotonos (hyperextension of the spine) and trismus (lockjaw) is the classic clinical triad for generalized tetanus. 3. Differential Exclusion: Viral meningoencephalitis is a consideration given the fever and respiratory prodrome, but is excluded by the normal CSF and MRI findings.

He is initially treated for cellulitis with amoxicillin-clavulanate, but the lesion rapidly deteriorates over the next two days. Surgical debridement reveals significant necrosis of the subcutaneous fat extending 1 to 3 cm beneath the intact wound margins (undermining). The condition progresses to form three distinct ulcers, including a large L-shaped lesion extending from the mid-calf to the toes. The patient currently resides in a semiarid region of Senegal and denies recent exposure to fresh water or swimming, though he lived in rural Guinea-Conakry three years ago. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Buruli Ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans infection),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient lives in West Africa, a region endemic for this condition. While he currently resides in a semiarid area (atypical), the disease is prevalent in the region, and long incubation periods are possible. 2. Clinical Anchor: The pathognomonic feature is the extensive necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue extending significantly beneath the undermined epidermal edges, caused by the cytotoxic lipid toxin mycolactone. 3. Differential Exclusion: Necrotizing fasciitis is a major differential due to the necrosis, but the time course here is subacute (weeks) rather than the rapid, fulminant progression seen in fasciitis; Cutaneous Leishmaniasis typically presents as a crater-like ulcer with raised borders but lacks the extensive, deep subcutaneous undermining seen here. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of the IS2404 insertion sequence, which is specific to Mycobacterium ulcerans.",10,10,5

Epidemiology: The patient resides in a newly identified endemic focus (coastal New South Wales, Australia) and reports a mosquito bite, a recognized vector for *Mycobacterium ulcerans* transmission from reservoir animals (possums). 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark feature is a painless or minimally painful ulcer with significantly undermined edges, resulting from the immunosuppressive and cytotoxic effects of the lipid toxin mycolactone. 3. Differential Exclusion: Pyoderma gangrenosum is a strong differential but is typically exquisitely painful (unlike this lesion) and associated with systemic inflammatory conditions. 4.

Additionally, a 2-cm firm nodule and an 8-cm indurated plaque are noted on the contralateral thigh. Routine antibiotic therapy for cellulitis has been ineffective. Histopathological analysis of a tissue specimen reveals acid-fast bacilli, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirms the presence of a specific mycobacterial insertion sequence.

Over several months, it evolved into a deep ulcer with fistula formation and significant edema of the hand. His medical history is notable for leprosy treated decades ago. He denies recent travel, reporting his last trip abroad was 8 months prior to Suriname, where he spent time fishing in creeks. Histopathological examination of a biopsy shows non-specific inflammation with no acid-fast bacilli visible on staining. Standard bacterial cultures are negative. However, a mycobacterial culture incubated at 30°C yields growth after 6 weeks, whereas cultures incubated at 37°C and 45°C remain negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Buruli Ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans infection),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a history of exposure to a tropical wetland environment (Suriname creeks) which is endemic for *Mycobacterium ulcerans*. The unique aspect here is the delayed presentation (latency) triggered by trauma in a non-endemic region (Netherlands). 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a chronic, necrotic ulcer with undermined edges (or extensive edema/fistulae) that fails standard wound care is characteristic. The definitive microbiological anchor is the specific growth requirement: the organism is a thermolabile mycobacterium that grows *only* at lower temperatures (30–32°C) and not at body temperature (37°C). 3. Differential Exclusion: *Mycobacterium marinum* shares the low-temperature growth preference but typically presents as superficial nodules or sporotrichoid lymphangitis following aquarium/fish exposure, rather than the deep, necrotizing, undermining ulcer seen in Buruli ulcer. Cutaneous tuberculosis grows at 37°C. 4.

A superficial swab of the ulcer is positive for Mycobacterium ulcerans DNA by PCR. He is treated with an 8-week course of rifampicin and clarithromycin. While the lesion shows initial signs of healing, the skin remains irregular and regression of healing is noted over the subsequent 2 months (8 months post-presentation).

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in an endemic region for *Mycobacterium ulcerans* (coastal Australia), explaining the initial Buruli ulcer diagnosis. However, the scalp is a highly atypical site for Buruli ulcer (usually limbs) but a very common site for cutaneous malignancies in elderly individuals. 2. Clinical Anchor: The \""red flag\"" is the incomplete healing and persistent irregularity despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for the confirmed *M. ulcerans* infection. While Buruli ulcer can have delayed healing, the atypical location and persistence suggest a dual pathology. 3. Differential Exclusion: Paradoxical reaction typically presents with increased inflammation during treatment, not persistent neoplastic-appearing irregularity after treatment completion; Secondary infection would likely present with acute inflammatory signs (purulence, increased pain) rather than a persistent non-healing plaque. 4.

Physical examination reveals a 2-cm, slightly elevated, erythematous, serpiginous tract located between the third and fourth toes on the dorsal aspect of the left foot. Laboratory evaluation shows a normal eosinophil count. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cutaneous Larva Migrans,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in a tropical region (Brazil) and has a specific history of direct skin contact with sandy soil (beach volleyball), which is a high-risk environment for soil contaminated with animal feces (hookworm larvae). 2.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a clear travel history to a tropical region (Jamaica) with specific high-risk behavior (walking barefoot on a beach), which exposes her to soil contaminated with hookworm larvae. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark finding is the 'creeping eruption' (serpiginous, migratory tracks). This specific case presents with a less common but recognized variant: *bullous* lesions accompanying the tracks, which can sometimes confuse the diagnosis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bullous Tinea Pedis is a differential but typically presents with vesicles/bullae without the characteristic migratory, linear tracks. Allergic Contact Dermatitis could cause bullae but would lack the serpiginous progression and travel association. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the classic clinical appearance of migratory tracks in a returning traveler, complicated by bullae (likely a hypersensitivity reaction to larval antigens), and the failure of mebendazole (which has low bioavailability) followed by resolution with ivermectin.",10,10,5

The anchor is the intensely pruritic, follicular papular rash that fails antibiotic therapy, combined with the subtle but diagnostic finding of short serpiginous tracts connecting the papules. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial Folliculitis (S. aureus or Pseudomonas) is the primary differential but is excluded by the lack of response to flucloxacillin and the presence of serpiginous tracts. Scabies causes pruritic papules but typically involves web spaces/wrists with distinct burrows, not the specific serpiginous tracks seen here. 4.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient's severe social neglect (homelessness, mental illness) is a major risk factor for massive, untreated parasitic infestations, leading to the \""exuberant\"" presentation seen here. 2. Clinical Anchor: The key diagnostic feature is the multiple papules with a central black dot (representing the posterior segment of the embedded female flea *Tunga penetrans*). The \""verrucous\"" texture results from pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia caused by the chronic, high-burden infestation. 3. Differential Exclusion: While the hyperkeratotic plaques mimic Verruca vulgaris (warts) or cutaneous tuberculosis (verrucosa cutis), the presence of the specific central black puncta within the lesions excludes these etiologies. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the visualization of the flea parts (eggs, larvae, or adult) via dermoscopy or histopathology.",10,10,5

He recently returned from an 8-day trip to the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador, where he stayed in indigenous communities, walked barefoot, and slept in huts with dirt floors. Physical examination reveals two distinct, raised papular lesions (5–6 mm in diameter) on the sole of the left foot. Each lesion is characterized by a well-circumscribed whitish halo surrounding a central blackish point . The lesions are painful to pressure. No other systemic symptoms such as fever or lymphadenopathy are present. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Tungiasis (Sand Flea Infestation),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a clear travel history to an endemic region (Amazon rainforest) and behavioral risk factors (walking barefoot, sleeping on dirt floors) conducive to acquiring ectoparasites found in soil. 2. Clinical Anchor: The pathognomonic presentation is the papular lesion with a central black dot (the posterior segment of the embedded flea) surrounded by a white hypertrophic halo. 3. Differential Exclusion: While myiasis (fly larvae) or plantar warts could cause nodular foot lesions, the specific morphology of the central black punctum with the white halo, combined with the acute onset after barefoot exposure in a tropical setting, strongly favors Tungiasis. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the extraction of the parasite, which often releases white eggs, or by the characteristic clinical appearance.",10,10,5

Physical examination reveals pitting edema in the bilateral upper and lower extremities and a distended abdomen with a small amount of ascites confirmed by ultrasound. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates severe hypoproteinemia (Total Protein 4.2 g/dL), profound hypoalbuminemia (Albumin 2.1 g/dL, later dropping to 1.7 g/dL), and hypocalcemia (7.2 mg/dL). A small bowel series shows granular jejunal mucosa with irregular thickening of the proximal loop. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Kwashiorkor (Secondary to Gastric Bypass / Protein-Calorie Malnutrition),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a history of gastric bypass surgery (12 years prior), which is a known but rare risk factor for severe malabsorptive malnutrition. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark presentation of severe hypoalbuminemia (causing pitting edema and ascites) despite reported adequate or high caloric/protein intake ('constantly hungry,' 'eating high protein') is the classic definition of Kwashiorkor (wet malnutrition), distinct from Marasmus (dry wasting). 3. Differential Exclusion: Cirrhosis could cause ascites and hypoalbuminemia, but liver enzymes are not mentioned as the primary driver, and the specific history of bariatric malabsorption points elsewhere. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) was considered due to diarrhea/ulceration but was considered low suspicion on capsule endoscopy; the severity of protein loss out of proportion to inflammation favors a malabsorptive etiology. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the constellation of severe protein malnutrition (edema, hypoalbuminemia) in the context of surgically altered anatomy that impairs absorption, termed iatrogenic or secondary Kwashiorkor.",8,8,5

Physical examination reveals cachexia with sunken orbits, 3+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, and a markedly distended, non-tender abdomen with a positive fluid wave. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates severe hypoalbuminemia (1.8 g/dL), normocytic anemia, and normal liver enzymes. Abdominal imaging confirms massive ascites and bilateral deep vein thromboses. Paracentesis yields transudative fluid with a serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) > 1.1 g/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Kwashiorkor (Protein-Energy Malnutrition),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a significant risk factor: a severely restricted diet (exclusively raw vegetables) due to a psychiatric condition (schizophrenia/reclusiveness) leading to profound protein deficiency. 2. Clinical Anchor: The classic presentation of \""wet\"" malnutrition is characterized by the triad of hypoalbuminemia, edema (anasarca/ascites), and skin/hair changes (though skin changes aren't prominent here, the edema is massive). The presence of massive ascites and edema in the absence of liver failure or heart failure is key. 3. Differential Exclusion: Cirrhosis is a strong differential given the ascites and elevated SAAG; however, the liver enzymes are normal, INR is normal (1.2), and there is no history of alcohol use or hepatitis risk factors. Marasmus involves calorie deficiency leading to wasting but typically lacks the severe edema and hypoalbuminemia seen here. 4.

The unexpected finding is the non-hepatic hyperammonemic coma. 3. Differential Exclusion: Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis is the primary differential for hyperammonemia and coagulopathy; however, imaging ruled out cirrhosis (showing only steatosis, typical of Kwashiorkor), and the specific amino acid profile (low essential AA, high glutamine, normal orotic acid) pointed to a functional urea cycle defect  caused by substrate depletion rather than hepatocellular failure. 4.

The patient is treated with a standard 7-day course of oral metronidazole; however, his symptoms persist, and a repeat stool examination two weeks later remains positive for the same organism. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Refractory Giardiasis (Giardia lamblia/intestinalis),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has significant acquired immunodeficiency due to the treatment of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (chronic corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors). This immunosuppression impairs the mucosal immune response (particularly IgA and T-cell function), predisposing the patient to chronic and treatment-refractory parasitic infections. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of chronic malabsorptive diarrhea (steatorrhea/bloating) and the pathognomonic stool microscopy finding of 'pear-shaped, binucleated trophozoites' anchors the diagnosis to Giardia lamblia. 3.

A punch biopsy is performed, and direct microscopy with KOH reveals clusters of round, thick-walled, brownish cells with internal septations (muriform cells). Fungal culture grows slow-growing, velvety, black colonies. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chromoblastomycosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a migrant from a tropical endemic region (Haiti) presenting in a non-endemic region (Chile), which is a key epidemiological clue for an imported (allochthonous) tropical disease. The lower limb location suggests prior traumatic inoculation. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmarks are the chronic \""cauliflower-like\"" verrucous plaque and the pathognomonic presence of muriform cells (also known as Medlar bodies, sclerotic bodies, or \""copper pennies\"") on microscopy, which are thick-walled, pigmented fungal cells. 3. Differential Exclusion: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is a critical differential for chronic non-healing warty lesions, especially in long-standing cases; however, the identification of specific fungal elements (muriform cells) rules out malignancy. Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis is another mimic but would show acid-fast bacilli rather than pigmented fungal bodies. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the isolation of a dematiaceous (black) fungus on culture, most likely *Fonsecaea* species, and the characteristic histopathological findings",10,10,5

He is originally from the Dominican Republic and travels there biannually, where he engages in recreational activities near beaches and lakes. He denies any specific trauma, though he mentions a distant history of gardening work. Physical examination reveals a solitary, 5-mm, well-demarcated, firm, dome-shaped papule on the ventral surface of the right index finger. The lesion is smooth, non-scaly, pale-to-skin-colored, and only slightly tender to palpation. There is no erythema or ulceration. A 4-mm punch biopsy is performed to rule out a digital fibrokeratoma or glomus tumor. Histopathologic examination demonstrates a nodular dermal aggregate of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells forming granulomas. Within these granulomas, brown-staining, thick-walled, septate structures are identified. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chromoblastomycosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from an endemic region (Dominican Republic) and has a history of potential environmental exposure (gardening, outdoor activity) where dematiaceous fungi reside. The extremely long latency (8 years) is characteristic of this indolent infection. 2.

The lesion has well-defined borders and features small, distinct black dots on the surface, with a few minute satellite lesions surrounding the main plaque. Direct mycological examination of skin scrapings prepared with 20% KOH reveals brownish septate hyphae and clusters of thick-walled, dark brown, multicellular structures. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chromoblastomycosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: While classically associated with rural agricultural workers, this case highlights an 'urban' presentation where the risk factor remains traumatic inoculation with organic matter (tree branch) in a recreational setting (urban forest). 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical hallmark is the verrucous plaque containing 'black dots' (representing hemopurulent material). The definitive anchor is the microscopic identification of muriform bodies (also known as sclerotic bodies or Medlar bodies) , which are pathognomonic, thick-walled, copper-colored fungal cells. 3.

His ocular history includes blepharitis and normal-tension glaucoma previously managed with latanoprost. He recently underwent cataract surgery but reports worsening vision post-operatively. Prior management for presumed medicamentosa-related keratitis—including the cessation of all topical glaucoma medications and the initiation of aggressive lubrication—has failed to alleviate his symptoms. Visual acuity is 20/150 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left. Slit-lamp examination of the right eye reveals diffuse epitheliopathy with punctate fluorescein staining and a subtle, underlying corneal epithelial opalescence. Additionally, a mildly thickened, inflamed pinguecula-like lesion is noted extending from the 2 to 5 o'clock position at the limbus. High-resolution anterior segment optical coherence tomography (HR-OCT) demonstrates a thickened, hyper-reflective epithelium with an abrupt transition from normal to abnormal tissue.

Clinical Anchor: The distinguishing features are the 'gelatinous' texture and the presence of a prominent 'feeder vessel' supplying the limbal mass. Rapid progression after a period of dormancy is also a red flag. 3.

Clinical Anchor: The presentation mimics necrotizing scleritis (pain, scleral thinning/melt) but is refractory to standard immunosuppressive therapy (prednisone). The specific 'red flag' is the presence of a gelatinous perilimbal nodule and the failure to respond to scleritis treatment, suggesting a 'masquerade syndrome'. 3. Differential Exclusion: Necrotizing Scleritis is the primary differential but is excluded by the lack of response to steroids and the presence of a distinct neoplastic-appearing mass (gelatinous nodule).

The 'acantholytic' variant is a rare histological subtype but clinically presents similarly to other invasive SCCs. 3. Differential Exclusion: Pterygium presents as a wing-shaped fibrovascular growth but typically lacks the significant elevation, papillomatous surface, keratinization, and rapid progression seen here. Pyogenic granuloma is usually a rapidly growing, pedunculated, vascular lesion often following trauma or surgery, unlike the insidious onset described. 4.

The AS-OCT finding of 'hyper-reflective epithelial thickening with abrupt transition' is a specific radiological sign for this condition. 3. Differential Exclusion: Pterygium typically presents as a wing-shaped fibrovascular growth but lacks the diffuse epithelial thickening and hyper-reflectivity seen on OCT, and usually does not cause such significant vision loss unless advanced. Pyogenic granuloma is usually pedunculated and follows trauma/surgery. 4.

Clinical Anchor: The classic triad of fever, massive splenomegaly, and pancytopenia (specifically severe thrombocytopenia) in a patient with significant weight loss is highly suggestive of visceral leishmaniasis. The massive splenomegaly is a hallmark feature. 3. Differential Exclusion: Lymphoma (e.g., splenic marginal zone lymphoma) could present with splenomegaly and weight loss, but the fever pattern and the specific travel history favor an infectious etiology. Malaria usually presents with cyclic fevers and less profound, massive splenomegaly compared to chronic visceral leishmaniasis. 4.

The incubation period can be years (latency), triggered by immunosuppression. 2. Clinical Anchor: The classic triad of fever, massive splenomegaly, and pancytopenia in an immunocompromised host is the hallmark. The clinical picture mimics lymphoma relapse or HLH. 3. Differential Exclusion: Lymphoma relapse is the primary differential but is excluded by the lack of response to chemotherapy (ibrutinib) and the specific microscopic findings.

A repeat bone marrow biopsy is performed. What is the most likely secondary diagnosis complicating his course?",Visceral leishmaniasis with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has confirmed Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), a known infectious trigger for secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), particularly in endemic tropical regions. 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical deterioration despite appropriate anti-leishmanial therapy is the key clue. The development of a coagulopathy (hypofibrinogenemia), markedly elevated ferritin (>80,000 ng/mL in this case), and multiorgan dysfunction in the setting of severe inflammation points towards a 'cytokine storm' syndrome. 3. Differential Exclusion: Sepsis is a major differential but serial blood cultures were negative. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is present but is part of the broader HLH syndrome here. Drug toxicity (Amphotericin) does not explain the full spectrum of high ferritin and hemophagocytosis. 4.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala-azar) presenting as Secondary HLH,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a specific travel history to the Mediterranean basin (Spain), which is endemic for *Leishmania infantum*. The 2-year lag time represents a latent period, often seen in visceral leishmaniasis. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is defined by the triad of fever, cachexia, and massive splenomegaly, accompanied by pancytopenia. The laboratory markers (high ferritin, sCD25, triglycerides) meet the diagnostic criteria for Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), acting as a 'masquerade' for the underlying infection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Splenic Lymphoma (e.g., splenic marginal zone lymphoma) is the primary differential given the massive spleen and high metabolic uptake on PET, but it is effectively excluded by two negative bone marrow biopsies and the lack of lymphadenopathy. Primary HLH is unlikely given the age of onset. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by positive serology (high titer IgG) for *Leishmania*, which is crucial when bone marrow aspirates are microscopically negative (a known phenomenon in immunocompetent hosts).

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient lives in an endemic region for Visceral Leishmaniasis (Brazil). However, the key risk factor here is the *relapsing* nature of the infection despite appropriate treatment, which strongly suggests an underlying immunodeficiency. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of recurrent/refractory Visceral Leishmaniasis and the specific phenotype of 'silvery hair and eyebrows' is the clinical anchor.

Visual acuity is significantly reduced bilaterally (20/80 OS, 20/40 OD), and VEPs show absent responses on the left and prolonged latency on the right. CSF analysis reveals lymphomonocytic pleocytosis (72/μL) and positive oligoclonal bands, with negative testing for AQP4 and MOG antibodies. Despite high-dose intravenous corticosteroids and plasmapheresis, her vision remains poor. One month later, she develops acute left-sided spastic hemiplegia and a progressive decline in vigilance. Repeat MRI demonstrates a fulminant increase in disease burden with over 100 new gadolinium-enhancing lesions, including extensive involvement of the periventricular, juxtacortical, and infratentorial regions. Serum neurofilament light chain levels are markedly elevated (340 pg/ml). What is the most likely diagnosis?",Marburg Variant of Multiple Sclerosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young female adult, the classic demographic for inflammatory demyelinating diseases, but the severity and rapidity distinguish this from typical Relapsing-Remitting MS. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is characterized by an acute, fulminant course (rapid progression to hemiplegia and altered vigilance within weeks) and a massive inflammatory burden on MRI (>100 enhancing lesions), which is the hallmark of the Marburg variant (acute fulminant MS). 3. Differential Exclusion: Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) and MOG-antibody disease are primary differentials for bilateral optic neuritis but are excluded by negative serology (AQP4/MOG negative). Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is considered but typically presents with encephalopathy at onset and is monophasic, whereas this patient had a distinct relapse (hemiplegia) within a month. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the combination of the specific clinical phenotype (fulminant progression, reduced vigilance), massive radiological activity (hundreds of enhancing lesions), and the exclusion of other mimics, defining this rare and aggressive form of MS.",10,10,5

One week later, she develops tetraplegia and drowsiness. Neurologic exam reveals severe dysphagia and altered mental status. MRI of the brain demonstrates fused, enhancing lesions extending from the choroid plexus into the periventricular white matter with a \""C-opening sign\"" and mass effect protruding into the lateral ventricle. A distinct extra-axial lesion is noted arising from the dura mater. All lesions show restricted diffusion (high DWI, low ADC). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis (54 cells/µL) with class 3 cytology and a single strong oligoclonal band. She is treated with steroids and palliative radiation but deteriorates and expires. Autopsy reveals extensive, sharply demarcated myelin loss with relative preservation of axons and no evidence of tumor cells. What is the most likely pathological diagnosis?",Marburg Variant of Multiple Sclerosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an elderly female (74 years old), which is an atypical age for primary demyelinating disease, raising suspicion for malignancy (lymphoma) or other etiologies. 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical presentation is fulminant (weeks) with rapid progression to tetraplegia and death. The radiological features are highly suggestive of Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL) due to mass effect, dural involvement, and restricted diffusion. However, the *pathological* anchor is the autopsy finding of sharply demarcated myelin loss with axonal preservation and macrophage infiltration, devoid of malignant cells. 3. Differential Exclusion: Primary CNS Lymphoma is the primary clinical differential given the age, MRI appearance (mass effect, subependymal spread), and steroid responsiveness (\""vanishing tumor\""). However, autopsy definitively ruled this out by the absence of lymphoma cells. Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a differential but typically follows an infection/vaccination and is less likely to show such massive, confluent demyelination with a fatal course in an elderly patient without a prodrome. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the post-mortem histopathology showing the hallmark features of the Marburg variant of MS: fulminant, massive demyelination with initial axonal preservation (though some early axonal damage can be seen in Marburg), occurring in a patient who clinically mimicked a brain tumor.",10,10,5

On admission, physical examination reveals a distended abdomen (80 cm perimeter) and a painful palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. Laboratory evaluation shows marked leukocytosis (38,200/mm³) with 0.4% eosinophils. Abdominal imaging initially suggested cholelithiasis and hepatomegaly. Due to clinical deterioration, an exploratory laparotomy is performed, revealing ischemic necrosis of the distal ileum, omentum, and appendix. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue demonstrates granulomatous inflammation with eggs and larvae within the mesenteric vessels. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Abdominal Angiostrongyliasis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in an endemic region (Caquetá, Colombia) where the zoonotic cycle involving rodents and slugs exists. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation mimics an acute abdomen or appendicitis with a right lower quadrant mass, but the prolonged course (35 days) and specific histopathological findings (granulomatous vasculitis with intra-arterial eggs/larvae) point to a parasitic etiology. 3. Differential Exclusion: Appendicitis is the primary differential but does not typically cause extensive ischemic necrosis with intra-vascular parasitic elements. Tuberculosis could cause granulomas but lacks the specific helminthic structures (larvae/eggs) found in the vessels. 4.

He undergoes surgery for suspected acute appendicitis. Intraoperative findings include inflammation involving the jejunum, distal ileum, cecum, appendix, and omentum. Histopathological analysis of the resected specimens reveals granulomatous inflammation, eosinophilic vasculitis, and the presence of nematode larvae and eggs within the vessel walls. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Abdominal Angiostrongyliasis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young child from a region in Colombia where the parasite is present, likely exposed via accidental ingestion of an intermediate host (slug/snail) or contaminated produce. 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical picture indistinguishable from acute appendicitis, combined with significant peripheral eosinophilia (10.9%), is a classic presentation for this helminthic infection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial appendicitis is the most common cause of RLQ pain but is typically associated with neutrophilia, not the marked eosinophilia seen here. Crohn's disease could cause ileitis and granulomas but would not feature parasitic eggs or larvae in the vasculature. 4.

Fundoscopy demonstrates massive macular edema and a motile larva located in the subretinal space of the inferotemporal quadrant . Laboratory evaluation shows eosinophilia in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Serum analysis for specific antibodies is negative, but the organism is identified by its physical characteristics. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Subretinal Angiostrongyliasis (Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient lives in an endemic region (Thailand) and has a specific dietary risk factor: consumption of raw snails (intermediate host) and fish (paratenic host). 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of eosinophilic meningitis followed by unilateral visual loss and the visualization of a motile subretinal larva is pathognomonic for ocular angiostrongyliasis. The 'rat lungworm' is the most common cause of eosinophilic meningitis in this demographic. 3. Differential Exclusion: Gnathostomiasis can cause ocular larva migrans but typically presents with migratory cutaneous swellings and distinct larval morphology. Cysticercosis would present with a cyst rather than a motile larva. Toxocariasis (ocular larva migrans) is a differential but is less likely to present with the preceding eosinophilic meningitis syndrome characteristic of *Angiostrongylus*. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed clinically by the direct visualization of the *Angiostrongylus* larva in the subretinal space, supported by the context of eosinophilic meningitis and peripheral/CSF eosinophilia.",10,10,5

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in Hainan Island, China, an endemic area for *Angiostrongylus cantonensis*. The consumption of raw/undercooked snails or contaminated produce (vectors) is a key risk factor in this region. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from nonspecific meningoencephalitis symptoms (fever, headache, stiff neck) to severe neurological decline (hydrocephalus, coma) unresponsive to antibacterial/antiviral therapy is a red flag. The delayed appearance of peripheral blood eosinophilia (41%) is a classic hallmark of parasitic meningitis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial meningitis was initially considered but ruled out by the lack of response to antibiotics and CSF profile (mononuclear dominance, normal glucose). Viral meningitis does not typically cause such severe hydrocephalus or significant eosinophilia. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis was definitively confirmed by Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) of the CSF, which detected *Angiostrongylus cantonensis* DNA sequences, allowing for targeted treatment with albendazole and steroids.",10,10,5

History reveals he ate a worm found in a takeaway meal one day prior to symptom onset. Physical exam is notable for severe quadriparesis (muscle strength Grade 1), neck stiffness, and papilledema. Lumbar puncture reveals elevated opening pressure (520 mm H2O) and a 'coconut-like' appearance of the cerebrospinal fluid. CSF analysis demonstrates significant eosinophilia (67%). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the CSF identifies a specific parasitic pathogen. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Central Nervous System Angiostrongyliasis (Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient lives in South China (an endemic area) and has a specific history of accidental ingestion of a worm (raw/undercooked intermediate host or paratenic host), which is the primary mode of transmission for this zoonotic parasite. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from cutaneous symptoms (itching) to severe neurological decline (eosinophilic meningoencephalitis/coma) combined with the specific finding of CSF eosinophilia (67%) anchors the diagnosis. The 'coconut-like' CSF appearance is a rare but noted description in high protein/cellularity states associated with this infection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was the initial working diagnosis due to weakness and cytoalbuminologic dissociation; however, the presence of fever, high CSF eosinophilia, and lack of response to IVIG/steroids rules this out. Bacterial meningitis is unlikely given the negative cultures and predominance of eosinophils rather than neutrophils. 4.

Clinical Anchor: The pathognomonic histological finding is the yeast cell with multiple narrow-based buds (Mickey Mouse ears or ship's pilot wheel appearance), which distinguishes it from other fungi. 3. Differential Exclusion: Crohn's disease is the primary differential diagnosis due to the presence of granulomatous ileitis, perforation, and strictures; however, Crohn's is an idiopathic inflammatory condition and would not present with fungal elements on silver stain.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a middle-aged male farmer from Colombia, a highly endemic region for Paracoccidioidomycosis (South American Blastomycosis). Occupational exposure to soil is a key risk factor. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a chronic, treatment-refractory eyelid lesion mimicking a neoplasm or chronic blepharitis in this demographic is a specific clue. The pathognomonic anchor is the biopsy finding of yeast cells with multiple peripheral buds (\""pilot's wheel\"" or \""steering wheel\"" appearance). 3.

His occupation as a wood merchant implies potential exposure to the Mastomys natalensis rodent reservoir in rural settings. 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical presentation is biphasic: an initial nonspecific febrile illness mimicking malaria (fever, vomiting, joint pain) that fails standard treatment, followed by a rapid decompensation into a hemorrhagic phase characterized by mucosal bleeding (epistaxis, hemoptysis) and shock. 3. Differential Exclusion: Severe Malaria is the initial working diagnosis and primary confounder; however, the patient's lack of response to appropriate antimalarial therapy and the subsequent development of frank hemorrhagic signs (bleeding diathesis) makes isolated malaria unlikely. Ebola Virus Disease is a critical differential but typically presents with a more abrupt onset; the specific geographic location (Kissidougou) and the endemicity patterns favor Lassa. 4.

Clinical Anchor: The presentation mixes features of a respiratory infection (cough, hypoxia, bibasilar crackles) with systemic signs often seen in severe Lassa Fever (acute kidney injury, anemia). The 'anchor' is the dual positivity, but clinically, the disproportionate renal failure alongside respiratory failure in this geography suggests more than simple pneumonia. 3. Differential Exclusion: Severe Malaria is a top differential for fever and renal failure in this region but is ruled out by negative testing. Hantavirus could cause renal/pulmonary syndrome but is epidemiologically less likely than Lassa in West Africa. 4.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a female in an endemic zone (Nigeria) presenting with fever refractory to antimalarials, a classic red flag for viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from constitutional symptoms (fever, anorexia) to specific neurological signs (neck stiffness, severe headache) mimics meningitis. However, the context of hypotension and thrombocytopenia in this region strongly anchors towards Lassa Fever, which can present with aseptic meningitis or encephalopathy. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial Meningitis is the primary distractor due to nuchal rigidity; however, the hematologic profile (thrombocytopenia) and the endemic context prioritize VHF. Cerebral Malaria is excluded by the lack of response to artemisinin-based therapy. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by a positive RT-PCR for Lassa Virus.

He has a history of gallstones, priapism, and frequent vaso-occlusive crises. He had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at age 25. On examination, he is febrile (37.8°C), deeply icteric, and has right upper quadrant tenderness with hepatomegaly. Laboratory results reveal a total bilirubin of 34.4 mg/dL (predominantly unconjugated), ALT 341 IU/L, and ALP 430 IU/L. Renal function and coagulation profile are normal. Abdominal imaging shows hepatomegaly and mild intrahepatic duct dilatation without biliary obstruction. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute Sickle Hepatic Crisis (Acute Sickle Liver),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has homozygous Sickle Cell Disease (HbSS), the genotype most associated with liver complications. He has a history of vaso-occlusive crises, placing him at risk for organ-specific sequestration or ischemia. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, tender hepatomegaly, and jaundice in a sickle cell patient is the classic triad for acute liver involvement. The key differentiator is the severity of bilirubin elevation relative to transaminases. 3. Differential Exclusion: Acute Sickle Intrahepatic Cholestasis is a more severe, often fatal variant, but it typically presents with coagulopathy, renal failure, and extreme transaminase elevations (often >1000 IU/L), none of which are present here. Viral hepatitis is unlikely given the clinical context of a crisis and the specific biochemical pattern. Biliary obstruction is ruled out by the history of cholecystectomy and the absence of obstructing stones on imaging. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis of Acute Sickle Hepatic Crisis is confirmed by the combination of clinical findings (tender hepatomegaly, fever), biochemical profile (bilirubin <15-30 mg/dL range usually, moderate ALT elevation), and the absence of liver failure (normal INR/renal function), resolving with supportive care and exchange transfusion.",5,3,5

The current presentation involves painful, symmetrical swelling of the hands and feet. Her parents, farmers from a rural village in the Ashanti region, initially sought care at a local health post where treatment was limited to basic analgesia. They report being socially ostracized by their community, who attribute the child's condition to spiritual causes or curses. Physical examination reveals dactylitis and pallor. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Sickle Cell Disease (SCD),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from the Ashanti region of Ghana (Sub-Saharan Africa), a region with the highest prevalence of Sickle Cell Disease globally. The onset of symptoms in late infancy (around 11 months) coincides with the decline of fetal hemoglobin. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of 'painful swelling of the hands and feet' (dactylitis or hand-foot syndrome) in a toddler is a classic, early clinical hallmark of Sickle Cell Disease. The history of recurrent fevers and pain crises ('Ahututuo' or body pinching) further supports this. 3. Differential Exclusion: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) could cause joint swelling but typically does not present with the specific pattern of dactylitis combined with recurrent fever and the severe, episodic pain crises characteristic of vaso-occlusion. Malaria is a consideration for fever but does not explain the symmetrical hand-foot swelling. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the clinical constellation of dactylitis and vaso-occlusive pain in an endemic region, which would be definitively diagnosed via hemoglobin electrophoresis or genetic testing.",8,10,5

He admits to being lost to follow-up for the past five years. On physical examination, he appears pale and chronically ill. His blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg. Laboratory evaluation reveals a hemoglobin of 5.4 g/dL and a significantly elevated serum creatinine of 2.81 mg/dL, corresponding to an eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2. Urinalysis demonstrates heavy proteinuria with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 744 mg/mmol. A review of medical records from five years prior shows a normal serum creatinine but documents the presence of microalbuminuria. Further workup confirms he is negative for diabetes mellitus, and serologies for lupus and viral hepatitis are non-reactive. Renal ultrasound shows no evidence of obstruction or structural anomalies. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Sickle Cell Nephropathy,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an older adult with homozygous sickle cell anemia (HbSS), placing him in the demographic at highest risk for developing cumulative end-organ damage, specifically renal insufficiency. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark feature is the progressive decline in renal function preceded by microalbuminuria (documented 5 years prior), which has now advanced to overt macroalbuminuria and Stage 4 chronic kidney disease. 3. Differential Exclusion: Diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive nephrosclerosis are the most common causes of similar presentations; however, this patient is explicitly normotensive and has no history of diabetes, making these diagnoses unlikely. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is established by the characteristic clinical trajectory of glomerular injury (hyperfiltration followed by sclerosis) directly attributable to sickle cell disease, after exclusionary testing rules out autoimmune and metabolic causes.",10,10,5

He reports generalized malaise but denies fever, cough, or weight loss. He notes similar, milder episodes of joint pain over the past six months that resolved with over-the-counter analgesics. Family history is significant for a maternal cousin with a chronic hematologic condition. Physical examination reveals moderate conjunctival pallor and scleral icterus. There is tenderness over the knees and elbows without erythema, warmth, or frank swelling. Abdominal examination demonstrates no splenomegaly. Laboratory evaluation shows a hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL, white blood cell count of 16.09 × 10⁹/L, and a platelet count of 781 × 10⁹/L. A peripheral blood smear demonstrates anisopoikilocytosis, target cells, sickled forms, and Howell-Jolly bodies. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Sickle Cell Disease (HbSS),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young adult male of African descent with a family history of hematologic disease, presenting with a delayed diagnosis which is less common but possible in resource-limited settings. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of paroxysmal vaso-occlusive pain crises (joint pain), chronic hemolytic anemia (icterus, pallor, reticulocytosis), and signs of functional asplenia (Howell-Jolly bodies, thrombocytosis) is the classic triad. 3. Differential Exclusion: Acute Leukemia could present with bone pain and leukocytosis; however, the presence of specific red cell morphologic changes (target cells, Howell-Jolly bodies) and the absence of blasts on the smear make this incorrect. Rheumatoid Arthritis is unlikely given the episodic nature of the pain and the absence of joint swelling or morning stiffness. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis demonstrating a predominance of Hemoglobin S (87%) and the complete absence of Hemoglobin A, consistent with the homozygous state.",8,10,5

She denies fever or recent travel. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent vaso-occlusive crises and a chronic leg ulcer. Physical examination reveals scleral icterus, a tender and enlarged liver palpated 4 cm below the costal margin, and lower extremity edema. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates severe anemia (Hemoglobin 6.7 g/dL), marked hyperbilirubinemia (Total Bilirubin 16.0 mg/dL, Direct Bilirubin 12.1 mg/dL), and significantly elevated Alkaline Phosphatase (445 U/L). Notably, Aminotransferases are only mildly elevated (AST 138 U/L, ALT 46 U/L). Coagulation studies show an INR of 1.37. An abdominal ultrasound and subsequent MRCP reveal hepatomegaly and mild biliary dilation but definitively exclude cholelithiasis or extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Viral hepatitis serologies are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Sickle Cell Intrahepatic Cholestasis (SCIC),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an adult with HbSS, predisposed to sickle cell hepatopathy due to chronic hemolysis and vascular occlusion. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark presentation is 'Extreme Hyperbilirubinemia' (often >10-50 mg/dL) that is disproportionately high compared to the mild elevation of transaminases (AST/ALT), in the absence of mechanical obstruction. This biochemical dissociation is pathognomonic for intrahepatic sickling. 3. Differential Exclusion: Choledocholithiasis (common in SCD due to pigment stones) is the primary distractor but is ruled out by the negative MRCP (no obstructing stone). Acute Hepatic Sequestration typically presents with a sudden, painful hepatomegaly and a precipitous drop in hemoglobin, but the bilirubin levels are rarely this massive, and it is primarily a volume-trapping crisis rather than a cholestatic failure. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is a clinical exclusion of extrahepatic obstruction and viral causes in a patient with SCD presenting with non-obstructive cholestatic liver failure, caused by sickling within the hepatic sinusoids leading to ischemia and ballooning of hepatocytes.",10,10,5

Review of systems is negative for fever or difficulty breathing. Ophthalmic examination reveals significant periorbital edema and erythema surrounding a 1-cm, round, painless ulcer with a central black, dry crust (eschar) . Visual acuity is preserved. A wound swab is obtained for Gram stain and culture, revealing large Gram-positive bacilli arranged in chains. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cutaneous Anthrax,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a history of handling raw animal products (meat from a butcher) in a potentially endemic setting, which is a known route of transmission for zoonotic spore-forming bacteria. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark finding is the \""malignant pustule\""—a painless, necrotizing ulcer with a central black eschar surrounded by disproportionate edema (gelatinous edema). Eyelid involvement is a rare but high-risk presentation known as palpebral anthrax. 3. Differential Exclusion: Preseptal Cellulitis (typically painful, warm, and lacks the characteristic black eschar); Brown Recluse Spider Bite (usually painful initially or develops a necrotic center more slowly with a \""red, white, and blue\"" sign, and lacks the Gram-positive rod findings). 4.

He discloses a history of slaughtering a goat that had died of unknown causes approximately 10 days prior to symptom onset. Physical examination reveals substantial non-pitting edema extending from the right hand to the forearm. On the dorsal wrist, there is a central ulceration covered by a black eschar, surrounded by a violaceous, edematous ring . Initial laboratory workup shows a leukocytosis with neutrophilia. A skin biopsy is performed; histopathology demonstrates necrosis with acute and chronic inflammation. Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining highlights clusters of bacilli within the tissue, while acid-fast staining is negative. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is performed on the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cutaneous Anthrax,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a butcher with direct exposure to a dead herbivore (goat), a classic zoonotic transmission route for *Bacillus anthracis* spores. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from a pruritic papule to a painless ulcer with a central black eschar (\""malignant pustule\"") surrounded by significant edema is pathognomonic. The \""rice-grain\"" description and subsequent blackening are highly specific. 3. Differential Exclusion: Spider bites (e.g., Loxoscelism) can cause necrosis but typically lack the extensive edema and the specific history of animal contact. Tularemia is another zoonosis (ulceroglandular) but is less likely to present with such a distinct black eschar and massive edema without prominent regional lymphadenopathy as the primary complaint in this context. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by mNGS identifying *Bacillus anthracis* sequences and the histological presence of PAS-positive bacilli clusters in the context of the specific exposure history.",6,10,5

These blisters subsequently ruptured and began bleeding, accompanied by severe pain and marked swelling of the entire right upper limb. He also reports fatigue and poor appetite but denies respiratory symptoms. His social history reveals he purchased and personally fed two cattle two months ago in a rural county known for sporadic zoonotic outbreaks. Vital signs show a heart rate of 128 bpm, respiratory rate of 20/min, and temperature of 38.1°C. Physical examination demonstrates significant non-pitting edema of the right arm and elbow with limited range of motion. The forearm displays numerous fuchsia-colored blisters and ruptured vesicles surrounding a central area of necrosis . A large (4cm x 4cm), firm, poorly mobile lymph node is palpable in the right axilla. Routine bacterial smears and cultures of the blister fluid are initially negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cutaneous Anthrax,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a farmer with recent direct contact with livestock (cattle) in an area with known previous anthrax cases (Zhouzhi County). This is a classic occupational exposure risk. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from papules to vesicles to a painless (or severe pain if compartment pressure rises due to edema) necrotic ulcer with massive, disproportionate non-pitting edema (\""malignant edema\"") is the hallmark. The \""fuchsia blisters\"" and satellite lesions are characteristic. The presence of a large, firm regional lymph node (lymphadenitis) further supports the diagnosis. 3.

Physical examination demonstrates significant erythema and non-pitting edema extending from the left neck to the anterior chest . A small, thorn-like wound with purulent discharge is visible on the left neck, though a classic black eschar is not yet apparent. A CT scan of the chest reveals widespread subcutaneous exudates and widened mediastinal shadows . Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cutaneous Anthrax,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a farmer with a history of direct contact with a dead herbivore (slaughtering a cow that died unexpectedly), which is a high-risk scenario for acquiring zoonotic Bacillus anthracis infection. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a 'malignant edema'—severe, rapidly spreading soft tissue swelling disproportionate to the visible wound—originating from a minor scratch on the neck is characteristic. The widened mediastinum on CT, typically associated with inhalational anthrax, can also occur in severe cutaneous cases involving the head and neck due to lymphatic drainage. 3. Differential Exclusion: Necrotizing fasciitis is a critical differential due to the rapid spread and shock; however, the specific epidemiological history of handling a dead cow and the presence of the 'thorn-like' inoculation site without crepitus favor anthrax. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the isolation of Gram-positive, spore-forming bacilli (Bacillus anthracis) from the wound exudate or blood, or positive PCR testing from the lesion.",10,10,5

Physical examination reveals a temperature of 36.4°C and pulse of 93 bpm. The left hand and forearm exhibit marked non-pitting edema and increased skin temperature. The dorsal aspect of the hand appears darkened, and distinct tension blisters are noted on the left wrist . Palpation reveals high tension and tenderness, with limited flexion and extension of the fingers. Initial laboratory workup is pending, and the preliminary clinical impression was severe cellulitis. Fluid aspirated from the blisters reveals Gram-positive rods. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cutaneous Anthrax,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a farmer with a clear history of contact with an infected herbivore (sick sheep) 10 days prior to symptom onset. This is the classic zoonotic transmission route for *Bacillus anthracis*. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from a localized lesion to severe, extensive edema (\""malignant edema\"") involving the entire forearm, coupled with the presence of \""tension blisters\"" and darkening (necrosis) of the skin, is highly characteristic. The history of \""cutting\"" the lesion likely exacerbated the spread, a known complication in anthrax management. 3. Differential Exclusion: Cellulitis (e.g., Staphylococcal or Streptococcal) is the primary differential due to redness and swelling; however, the specific contact with a sick sheep, the formation of dark tension blisters, and the rapid development of massive edema favor anthrax. The Gram stain showing large Gram-positive rods further excludes typical Streptococci (cocci in chains) or Staphylococci (cocci in clusters). 4.

HIV serology and autoimmune panels are negative. A chest CT scan demonstrates bilateral, diffuse, hazy patchy shadows and ground-glass opacities . Empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics (levofloxacin, meropenem) fails to improve his condition. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: While classically associated with HIV/AIDS, the patient presents with a non-HIV immunocompromised state caused by long-standing, poorly controlled diabetes and renal failure, which can induce severe lymphopenia and T-cell dysfunction. 2. Clinical Anchor: The triad of progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, severe lymphopenia, and markedly elevated LDH in an immunocompromised host is highly suggestive. The specific radiological pattern of bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities further anchors the diagnosis. 3.

On examination, he is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, tachycardic at 116 bpm, and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 90% on high-flow oxygen. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse crackles. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest demonstrates bilateral ground-glass opacities with peripheral sparing and interstitial infiltrates. Notably, the imaging also reveals variable-sized thin-walled cysts (pneumatoceles) predominantly in the upper lobes and subpleural regions . Sputum analysis for acid-fast bacilli and bacterial culture is negative. Serum (1-3)-beta-D-glucan levels are markedly elevated at 417 pg/mL. His CD4 count is found to be 16/µL. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cystic Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a newly diagnosed, treatment-naive HIV-positive individual with severe immunosuppression (CD4 count < 200/µL), placing him at extremely high risk for opportunistic infections, particularly Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). 2. Clinical Anchor: The classic triad of subacute dyspnea, dry cough, and fever in an HIV patient points to PCP. The specific radiological finding of 'pneumatoceles' or thin-walled cysts co-existing with ground-glass opacities is a characteristic, though less common (10-34%), manifestation of PCP known as Cystic PCP. These cysts significantly increase the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. 3. Differential Exclusion: Pulmonary Tuberculosis is a primary differential in HIV but typically presents with consolidation, cavitation, or tree-in-bud opacities rather than thin-walled cysts and ground-glass attenuation; sputum tests were also negative. Lymphocytic Interstitial Pneumonia (LIP) can present with cysts in HIV patients but is generally associated with higher CD4 counts and lacks the acute/subacute hypoxic decompensation seen here. Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia can cause pneumatoceles but typically presents with a fulminant, acute bacterial course rather than a 2-month indolent progression. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is strongly supported by the markedly elevated serum (1-3)-beta-D-glucan (a sensitive marker for PCP) combined with the pathognomonic HRCT pattern of upper-lobe predominant cysts and ground-glass opacities in a severely immunocompromised host.",10,10,5

Her current medication regimen includes subcutaneous certolizumab pegol, methotrexate, and daily oral prednisolone. On admission, lung auscultation is clear. Laboratory evaluation reveals leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, and an elevated LDH of 396 U/L. Notably, a serum (1,3)-β-D-glucan level is drawn and returns within normal limits (12.1 pg/mL). A chest CT reveals patchy ground-glass opacities and infiltrative shadows in the upper lobes. Sputum culture isolates methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and she is started on piperacillin-tazobactam. However, over the next 8 days, her fever persists, and she develops progressive hypoxemia. Repeat imaging shows a marked worsening of the pulmonary infiltrates, now diffuse throughout both lungs . A repeat serum (1,3)-β-D-glucan level is obtained on hospital day 11, which returns elevated at 40.0 pg/mL. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is significantly immunocompromised, not from HIV, but due to iatrogenic suppression (biological agents, methotrexate, steroids) for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Non-HIV patients with PCP often have lower fungal burdens than HIV-positive patients, leading to diagnostic challenges. 2. Clinical Anchor: The crucial diagnostic pivot is the *seroconversion* of the (1,3)-β-D-glucan level. The initial negative result likely reflected a low fungal load, but the subsequent rise during clinical deterioration—despite broad-spectrum antibacterial coverage—is a strong indicator of an underlying fungal etiology like Pneumocystis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial pneumonia (specifically MSSA found in sputum) is a distractor; the lack of response to appropriate antistaphylococcal therapy (piperacillin-tazobactam) and the progression of ground-glass opacities argue against a purely bacterial cause. Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis is a differential for interstitial lung disease in this context, but it does not cause an elevation in fungal markers like β-D-glucan. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is supported by the characteristic radiological progression to diffuse ground-glass opacities, the rising β-D-glucan levels, and the eventual clinical resolution following the switch to targeted therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids",10,10,5

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient received an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), pembrolizumab. While ICI-related pneumonitis is a common adverse event, opportunistic infections like PCP are rare but documented complications, even in patients without traditional risk factors (like prior steroids or chemotherapy). The patient's age and potential asymptomatic colonization (common in COPD) are contributory factors. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and hypoxia is the clinical anchor. However, the *key* differentiating features here are the elevated β-D-glucan and LDH, which are classic surrogates for PCP, and the failure to respond adequately to steroids alone (which usually improves ICI-pneumonitis). 3. Differential Exclusion: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-related Pneumonitis (CIP) is the primary differential and was the initial working diagnosis; however, the positive β-D-glucan and the subsequent positive PCR for *Pneumocystis* definitively rule this out as the sole etiology. Bacterial pneumonia is unlikely given the negative cultures and diffuse GGO pattern. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the positive PCR for *Pneumocystis* DNA in the sputum, supported by the elevated β-D-glucan and the clinical resolution after adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) to the regimen.",10,10,5

","1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a traveler returning from a high-transmission zone (Cameroon) with a history of using an ineffective, non-pharmaceutical prophylaxis (Artemisia annua tea), placing him at extreme risk for infection. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark triad of fever, severe thrombocytopenia, and rapidly progressive acute kidney injury (creatinine >300 µmol/L) is highly suggestive of severe malaria. 3. Differential Exclusion: Leptospirosis is a key differential in the Amazonian setting (French Guiana) that presents with fever and renal failure (Weil's disease); however, it is excluded by the specific parasitological evidence (positive HRP2/pLDH and ring forms on smear). 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis of severe malaria is confirmed by the identification of Plasmodium falciparum (via HRP2 antigen and smear) combined with WHO severity criteria (acute renal failure).",10,10,5

Initial laboratory evaluation reveals marked thrombocytopenia (platelets 58 x 10^9/L), mild anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Due to the denial of any recent travel and the hematologic abnormalities, he is referred to a hematology center for suspected malignancy/bone marrow evaluation. Over the next 48 hours, he deteriorates with worsening jaundice, splenomegaly (17 cm), and a drop in platelets to 21 x 10^9/L. Upon re-interviewing the family, it is revealed he returned 3 days ago from a 16-day stay in Mozambique. His condition progresses to altered mental status, meningeal signs (nuchal rigidity), and respiratory failure requiring intubation. A repeat thin blood smear demonstrates intraerythrocytic ring forms. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Severe Plasmodium falciparum Malaria,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The critical pivot in this case is the delayed revelation of travel to Mozambique (a high-transmission zone) by a patient presenting in a malaria-free region (Iraq). 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of acute febrile illness, severe thrombocytopenia, jaundice, and rapid neurological deterioration (cerebral involvement/meningeal signs) in a returning traveler is the classic presentation of severe malaria. 3. Differential Exclusion: Hematologic malignancy (e.g., leukemia) was initially suspected due to thrombocytopenia but is inconsistent with the acute febrile onset and rapid resolution with antimicrobial therapy. Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (e.g., Yellow Fever) are a consideration given the geography, but the presence of intraerythrocytic parasites on the smear definitively rules this out. 4.

She returned 4 days ago from a 2-week trip to Kazakhstan, with a short transit stop in Istanbul. She explicitly denies any travel to tropical regions or other continents. Initial evaluation reveals anemia and elevated inflammatory markers. Due to the severity of her neurological status and persistent fever, a broad infectious disease workup is initiated. Unexpectedly, a peripheral blood smear reveals a massive burden of intraerythrocytic organisms, with a calculated density of 30% infected red blood cells (845,880/µL). What is the most likely diagnosis?",Severe Plasmodium falciparum Malaria (Airport Malaria),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The case presents a diagnostic paradox: the patient traveled only to a certified malaria-free country (Kazakhstan). However, the transit through a major international hub (Istanbul) introduces the rare but critical risk of \""Airport Malaria\""—acquiring an infection from an imported mosquito in a non-endemic setting. 2. Clinical Anchor: The definitive clinical anchor is the finding of hyperparasitemia (30% infected erythrocytes) on the blood smear. This degree of parasite burden causes severe neuro-cognitive symptoms and is pathognomonic for severe falciparum malaria, regardless of the travel history. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial Meningitis or Viral Encephalitis are the top differentials given the fever and neurological decline in a patient with a \""safe\"" travel history. These are excluded by the direct visualization of parasites in the blood. 4.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute Schistosomiasis (Katayama Syndrome),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The critical epidemiological link is the recent travel (6 weeks prior) to Guinea (sub-Saharan Africa) and the specific exposure to freshwater (swimming), which poses a high risk for Schistosomiasis. The \""transient pruritic sensation\"" corresponds to \""swimmer's itch\"" caused by cercarial penetration. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction (fever, myalgia, eosinophilia) combined with pulmonary micronodules and gastrointestinal symptoms (bloody diarrhea) in a returning traveler anchors the diagnosis to Katayama Syndrome. The pulmonary nodules represent granulomatous reactions to egg deposition or larval migration. 3. Differential Exclusion: Miliary Tuberculosis is a strong radiological differential but is less likely given the rapid onset (5 days) of acute systemic symptoms, eosinophilia, and negative sputum. Vasculitis (e.g., EGPA) is considered due to asthma/eosinophilia but lacks the specific infectious exposure history. 4.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a specific history of freshwater exposure ('swimming in lakes') in sub-Saharan Africa, a region endemic for Schistosoma species. The 4-6 week lag time between exposure and symptom onset is characteristic of the incubation period for the acute phase. 2. Clinical Anchor: The triad of fever, urticarial rash ('safari itch'), and marked eosinophilia in a returning traveler—especially after malaria has been excluded—is the classic presentation of Katayama fever. The presence of respiratory symptoms (cough) and hepatosplenomegaly further supports this systemic hypersensitivity reaction. 3.

A prior skin biopsy at an outside institution reportedly showed non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of sarcoidosis; however, a one-week course of steroid therapy yielded no improvement. On physical examination, indurated papules with a rubbery texture are noted across the lower legs, upper thighs, arms, back, scrotum, soles of the feet, and perioral area. Some lesions are annular with fine scaling. Routine laboratory evaluation is significant for proteinuria, though other metabolic parameters are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Secondary Syphilis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young male with a recent HIV diagnosis, placing him in a high-risk demographic for sexually transmitted co-infections, specifically syphilis. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of a diffuse, non-pruritic, \""rubbery\"" papular rash involving the soles of the feet (palmoplantar involvement) and renal dysfunction (proteinuria) is highly suggestive of secondary syphilis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Sarcoidosis was the initial working diagnosis due to the finding of non-necrotizing granulomas; however, the lack of response to steroids, the specific texture of the lesions (rubbery), and the involvement of the soles make syphilis the more likely \""great mimicker\"" in this context. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by a high-titer RPR (1:512) and positive specific immunohistochemical staining for Treponema pallidum on re-evaluation of the skin biopsy.",10,10,5

He reports having sex exclusively with men and states he has been in a monogamous relationship for the past 8 months. On physical examination, diffuse macular rashes are noted, along with scarred, painless lesions on the glans penis. Palpation of the neck reveals bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy. Routine laboratory screening for HIV is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Secondary Syphilis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a man who has sex with men (MSM), a demographic group with a higher incidence of sexually transmitted infections, despite the self-report of recent monogamy. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of constitutional symptoms (headache, arthralgia, malaise) with a generalized macular rash and lymphadenopathy, occurring weeks after the likely appearance of a painless genital lesion (now scarred), is the classic presentation of the secondary stage of this spirochetal infection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Acute HIV seroconversion could present with similar constitutional symptoms and rash but is less likely given the specific presence of scarred painless genital lesions (healed chancres) and the negative HIV test; Gonorrhea typically presents with urethritis or purulent discharge rather than a generalized rash and systemic symptoms. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by a reactive non-treponemal test (VDRL) followed by a positive specific treponemal antibody test (fluorescent antibody absorption or similar).",10,10,5

He reports shedding of the scalp and numbness/tingling in the lower extremities. His social history is significant for sexual activity with men, with no prior diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections. On physical examination, there is diffuse, scaly alopecia with a rough texture specifically involving the frontotemporal area, described as a 'Crown of Venus' pattern, along with eyebrow loss. Cutaneous findings include an irregular erythematous rash on the palms and web spaces, brown macules on the soles, and multiple painless ulcerated penile lesions. He also has oral mucosal plaques and conjunctival hyperemia. Serologic testing reveals a Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) titer of 1:2048. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Secondary Syphilis (with Neurosyphilis and Ocular Syphilis),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young male who has sex with men (MSM), a high-risk demographic for syphilis and HIV co-infection. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of the \""Crown of Venus\"" alopecia (frontotemporal hair loss), palmoplantar rash, and painless penile ulcers is classic for secondary syphilis. The neurologic and ocular symptoms indicate systemic involvement. 3. Differential Exclusion: Alopecia Areata typically presents as smooth, non-scaly patches and lacks the systemic mucosal and palmoplantar findings. Cryptococcal meningitis (which the patient also had) explains the headache but does not account for the characteristic dermatologic findings like the palmar rash or the specific pattern of alopecia. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the markedly elevated non-treponemal titer (RPR 1:2048) and the clinical response to penicillin therapy.",8,10,5

Physical examination reveals erythematous scaly patches with crusty edges on the extremities and trunk, scattered nodular lesions on the lower limbs, and distinct targetoid lesions on the thighs. He has background facial erythema consistent with rosacea but no genital, anal, or orolabial lesions. He denies systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or weight loss. A skin biopsy demonstrates hyperkeratosis with a perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Secondary Syphilis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an elderly male who, upon further questioning, admits to multiple unprotected sexual encounters in recent months, a key risk factor often overlooked in this age group. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a persistent, asymptomatic, generalized rash that mimics other dermatoses (like eczema or erythema annulare centrifugum) and fails to respond to standard therapy is a classic hallmark of the 'Great Imitator.' The specific finding of targetoid and nodular lesions alongside scaly plaques is highly suggestive. 3. Differential Exclusion: Eczema and drug hypersensitivity are initial considerations but are ruled out by the lack of response to steroids/antibiotics and the absence of a culprit medication. Cutaneous lymphoma is a concern given his age and the persistent plaques, but the biopsy lacks malignant features. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by positive serologic testing (VDRL 1:16 and TPHA 1:1280) and the complete resolution of lesions following Benzathine penicillin G treatment.",8,10,5

On admission, she is febrile (38.2°C), tachycardic, and jaundiced. Physical examination reveals a palpable ill-defined mass in the right upper quadrant and splenomegaly. Laboratory evaluation shows leukocytosis, mixed hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and coagulopathy (INR 1.82). A CT scan demonstrates hepatosplenomegaly, dilated intrahepatic bile ducts, and coarse parenchymal calcifications in liver segments V and VII, which have increased in size compared to prior imaging. There are also calcified hilar lymph nodes compressing the common bile duct. Intraoperative exploration reveals a grossly nodular liver with yellow-white calcified nodules and thickened portal tracts. Biopsy of a hepatic nodule is performed. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in an endemic region (Philippines) where both tuberculosis and schistosomiasis are prevalent. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark feature is the presence of 'Symmers pipestem fibrosis' (thickened portal tracts seen on intraoperative ultrasound) and calcified hepatic nodules, which mimic tuberculosis but are characteristic of chronic egg deposition and granuloma formation in schistosomiasis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Hepatic Tuberculosis is the primary distractor and was the incorrect working diagnosis for years; however, the lack of response to anti-TB therapy, the specific pattern of portal fibrosis (pipestem), and the absence of constitutional TB symptoms (night sweats, chronic cough) favor the parasitic etiology. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is definitively confirmed by the liver biopsy demonstrating multiple Schistosoma eggs within the calcified granulomas.",8,10,5

He reports being treated for Plasmodium falciparum malaria one year ago while en route to Europe. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the left upper quadrant and palpable splenomegaly (spleen 19 cm). Laboratory evaluation shows pancytopenia (Hb 7.9 mmol/L, platelets 42 × 10^9/L, leukocytes 1.0 × 10^9/L) and elevated total IgE (254 × 10^3 IU/L). Liver function tests are normal. Imaging demonstrates significant splenomegaly, signs of portal hypertension including esophageal varices, and moderate-to-severe liver fibrosis on elastography. Repeated stool and urine microscopy for ova and parasites are negative, as are rectal snip biopsies. A diagnostic liver biopsy is performed to elucidate the etiology of the fibrosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from a high-endemicity region (Eritrea) presenting with classic signs of portal hypertension (splenomegaly, varices, pancytopenia from hypersplenism) in the absence of viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of 'pipestem' type fibrosis (suggested by elastography/MRI) and portal hypertension with preserved hepatocellular function (normal LFTs, normal bilirubin) is the hallmark of Schistosoma mansoni infection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Cirrhosis from viral hepatitis is excluded by negative serologies; Leishmaniasis (Visceral) is unlikely given the negative serology and bone marrow biopsy; Malaria causes splenomegaly but does not typically lead to the chronic portal fibrosis seen here. 4. Confirmation: Despite the 'occult' nature (negative stool/urine/rectal biopsy likely due to low worm burden from prior antimalarial therapy), the diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of a viable Schistosoma mansoni egg (with lateral spine) on liver biopsy.",8,9,5

An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) demonstrates Grade III and IV esophageal varices. A liver biopsy is performed and reveals normal liver parenchyma with no evidence of cirrhosis. The patient requires intervention for her thrombocytopenia to facilitate safe variceal banding. What is the most likely diagnosis underlying her clinical presentation?",Hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis,1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from a highly endemic region (sub-Saharan Africa: Congo/Tanzania) where Schistosoma mansoni is prevalent. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of severe portal hypertension (large varices) and hypersplenism (severe pancytopenia) in the *absence* of liver cirrhosis (normal parenchyma on biopsy) is the classic presentation of presinusoidal portal hypertension caused by hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Cirrhosis is ruled out by the liver biopsy showing normal parenchyma. Portal vein thrombosis could cause similar symptoms but typically lacks the specific epidemiologic link and would be a diagnosis of exclusion after parasitic causes in this demographic. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is supported by the history of praziquantel treatment (implying prior positive testing) and the clinical picture of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension with hypersplenism typical of chronic egg deposition in the periportal tracts (Symmers fibrosis).,10,10,5
309,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8726476/,"A 19-year-old male from Guinea presents with a history of recurrent hematemesis. He has a known diagnosis of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, treated previously with praziquantel. Despite pharmacological management with non-selective beta-blockers, he has experienced multiple episodes of variceal bleeding. Physical examination reveals massive splenomegaly but no signs of decompensated liver failure (no ascites, no jaundice, no encephalopathy). Laboratory evaluation shows stable liver function tests with preserved synthetic function, but significant thrombocytopenia likely due to hypersplenism. He is evaluated for a definitive intervention to lower portal pressure. Pre-interventional hemodynamic monitoring confirms a significantly elevated portosystemic pressure gradient. He subsequently undergoes a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure. What is the most likely diagnosis underlying his portal hypertension?",Hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young male from West Africa (Guinea), a highly endemic region for *Schistosoma mansoni*, presenting with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. 2. Clinical Anchor: The classic presentation is 'presinusoidal' portal hypertension—manifesting as variceal bleeding and splenomegaly—in the presence of preserved hepatocellular function (normal synthetic liver tests). This dissociation between severe portal hypertension and preserved liver function is hallmark. 3. Differential Exclusion: Liver Cirrhosis (e.g., viral or alcoholic) typically presents with signs of hepatocellular failure (jaundice, coagulopathy not just from hypersplenism) and a nodular liver parenchyma, whereas this patient has normal synthetic function. Portal Vein Thrombosis could cause similar symptoms but is less likely to be the primary cause without a prothrombotic risk factor, and the specific epidemiology points strongly to the parasitic etiology. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the history of *Schistosoma* infection (treated with praziquantel) and the clinical picture of Symmers' pipestem fibrosis leading to presinusoidal block, necessitating TIPS for variceal decompression.",10,10,5

Physical examination reveals a severely wasted and stunted adolescent with marked pallor. Abdominal inspection shows distention with engorged superficial veins. Palpation demonstrates a firm hepatomegaly 7 cm below the right costal margin and splenomegaly 5 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory evaluation shows severe microcytic anemia (hemoglobin 35 g/L), prolonged prothrombin time, and normal white blood cell and platelet counts. Notably, serum bilirubin, transaminases, and albumin levels are within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound reveals a mosaic parenchymal pattern with hyperechoic bands thickening the portal vein branches. Upper endoscopy confirms the presence of esophageal varices. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma japonicum),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in an endemic region (Leyte, Philippines) with a history of freshwater exposure, which is the primary risk factor for infection with Schistosoma japonicum. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark presentation is presinusoidal portal hypertension (manifested as variceal bleeding/melena and splenomegaly) occurring in the setting of preserved hepatocellular function (normal liver enzymes and albumin). The ultrasound finding of hyperechoic periportal thickening is characteristic of Symmers' clay pipestem fibrosis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Liver cirrhosis (e.g., from chronic Hepatitis B) is a primary differential but is unlikely due to the absence of hepatocellular necrosis (normal AST/ALT) and the preservation of synthetic function despite severe portal hypertension; the specific 'pipestem' fibrotic pattern is also distinct from the nodular regeneration of cirrhosis. 4.

Initial laboratory evaluation reveals profound hypereosinophilia (9,688 cells/mL) and mild elevation of aspartate aminotransferase. Stool ova and parasite examination is negative. Serologic testing for *Trichinella spiralis* is positive, but the patient lacks myalgia or elevated creatine kinase, leading to this being dismissed. He is initially diagnosed with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and treated with high-dose corticosteroids without improvement. Repeat imaging via abdominal CT months later demonstrates multiple hypodense liver nodules. A liver biopsy performed during the initial workup had shown chronic active hepatitis with acute necrosis and eosinophils in portal spaces. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Fascioliasis (Fasciola hepatica infection),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an elderly male with no travel history (autochthonous case in Belgium). While rare in this region, the key risk factor—later identified—is the consumption of raw vegetables from a garden flooded by pasture runoff (contaminated by ruminant feces). 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of persistent fever, abdominal pain, massive eosinophilia, and specific liver findings (hypodense nodules on CT) is classic for the acute/hepatic phase of fascioliasis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Idiopathic Hypereosinophilic Syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and incorrect because of the infectious etiology. Trichinellosis was suggested by serology (likely cross-reactivity) but excluded due to the absence of muscle involvement (myalgia/CK). 4.

Differential Exclusion: Visceral Larva Migrans (Toxocariasis) is a differential for eosinophilia and liver lesions but typically presents with more diffuse, smaller ill-defined lesions rather than the large, migrating tracts seen here. Lymphoma was initially suspected due to the lesions but is ruled out by the migratory nature of the masses and the specific biopsy findings (eosinophilic granulomas vs. malignant lymphocytes). 4.

An MRI further characterizes these as subcapsular, poorly defined lesions with a serpiginous pattern. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Fascioliasis (Fasciola hepatica infection),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in a rural region and consumes raw watercress, which is the primary vector for the metacercariae of this trematode.  This dietary habit is the classic route of transmission. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of fever, right upper quadrant pain, and marked peripheral eosinophilia constitutes the classic triad for the acute hepatic phase. The specific \""serpiginous\"" or tunnel-like appearance of the liver lesions on MRI  represents the pathognomonic migration tracks of the immature flukes through the hepatic parenchyma. 3.

Clinical Anchor: The daughter's observation of a moving object and the clinician's visualization of a whitish, sinusoidal worm in the subconjunctival space (the \""African eye worm\"") is pathognomonic. The worm's transient nature (disappearing before the specialist visit) is also characteristic of *Loa loa* migration. 3. Differential Exclusion: While other nematodes like *Dirofilaria* can cause ocular infections, the specific geographic history (Central Africa) and the macroscopic appearance of the migrating worm strongly favor *Loa loa*. *Onchocerca* typically causes keratitis rather than visible subconjunctival worms. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is clinical, based on the visualization of the adult worm (often confirmed by photo evidence as in this case) and the specific travel history to an endemic zone.",8,10,5

He reports seeing a \""worm\"" moving across his eye in the mirror the previous night. He emigrated from Cameroon seven years ago and has no significant past medical history, though he recalls an episode of unexplained, transient swelling in his right forearm several years prior. On physical examination, visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. The left eye exhibits mild conjunctival injection and chemosis. Slit-lamp examination reveals a thin, translucent, motile nematode moving within the sub-bulbar conjunctival space. When illuminated by the microscope light, the organism rapidly migrates posteriorly out of view. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates a leukocyte count with 14% eosinophilia. A peripheral blood smear reveals a high concentration of microfilariae (>17,000 mf/mL). Testing for Onchocerca and Wuchereria is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ocular Loiasis (African Eye Worm),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an immigrant from Cameroon, a region in Central Africa hyper-endemic for this filarial nematode. The parasite's long lifespan (up to 17 years) explains the presentation seven years after emigration. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark presentation is the \""African eye worm\""—a macroscopic adult worm migrating across the subconjunctival space . This is often accompanied by a history of \""Calabar swellings\"" (transient angioedema), described here as unexplained forearm swelling. 3. Differential Exclusion: Onchocerca volvulus (River Blindness) is a key differential in this geographic demographic but typically causes keratitis or chorioretinitis rather than a visible subconjunctival worm. Dirofilaria can present as an ocular worm but is zoonotic, typically forms a static granulomatous nodule, and does not present with high-grade microfilaremia. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the visualization of the adult worm and the presence of specific microfilariae in the peripheral blood. The high microfilarial load necessitated pheresis prior to diethylcarbamazine treatment to prevent encephalopathy.",8,10,5

Initial serologic testing is positive for *Fasciola hepatica* and *Toxocara canis*, but treatment for these conditions yields only transient improvement followed by relapse. A liver biopsy is performed, revealing granuloma formation around nematode eggs and adult worms. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hepatic Capillariasis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young child with a history of pica (ingesting soil) living in potentially crowded conditions, which is the primary risk factor for ingesting embryonated eggs of *Calodium hepaticum* from rodent-contaminated soil. 2. Clinical Anchor: The triad of persistent fever, hepatomegaly, and massive eosinophilia in a child with pica is highly suggestive of visceral larva migrans or hepatic parasitosis. The specific finding of eggs and worms *in the liver biopsy* despite negative stool exams is key, as *C. hepaticum* does not release eggs into the intestine (they remain trapped in the liver). 3. Differential Exclusion: *Fasciola hepatica* and *Toxocara canis* are the primary distractors (and potential serological cross-reactors); however, *Fasciola* eggs are typically found in stool (unless ectopic/acute), and *Toxocara* typically presents with migrating larvae rather than the specific egg deposition seen on biopsy. The biopsy morphology (eggs with polar plugs in the liver parenchyma) definitively rules out these differentials. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the histological identification of *Calodium hepaticum* eggs (with characteristic polar plugs and striated shells) within hepatic granulomas, verified by PCR.",8,10,5

Subsequent PET scan shows mild FDG uptake (SUVmax 3.1), and MRI demonstrates a non-enhancing lesion without cystic features or diffusion restriction. Due to the indeterminate nature of the lesion, a segmental hepatectomy is performed. Histopathological examination reveals necrotizing eosinophilic granulomas with central necrotic zones containing hepatocyte debris and Charcot-Leyden crystals. Within these lesions, degenerated nematode larvae measuring approximately 53 μm in diameter are identified. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hepatic Capillariasis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an adult with extensive global travel, though the infection is zoonotic (rodent host) and often acquired via ingestion of embryonated eggs from soil (pica is common in children, but adults can be infected via contaminated food/water). 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is often asymptomatic or mimics a hepatic mass/malignancy (pseudotumor) in adults. The key histological findings are 'necrotizing eosinophilic granulomas' containing 'degenerated nematode larvae' or specific barrel-shaped eggs in the liver parenchyma. 3. Differential Exclusion: Visceral Larva Migrans (Toxocara) causes eosinophilic granulomas but the larvae are smaller and serology (Western blot) was negative in this case. Echinococcosis presents with cystic lesions (hydatid cysts), unlike the solid, granulomatous mass seen here. Liver metastasis was a concern given the history of thymoma, but the histology showing parasitic elements rules this out. 4.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an elderly immigrant from an endemic region (China), which is a risk factor for *Entamoeba histolytica* exposure. Amoebic liver abscesses (ALA) can have a very long latency period (years). 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical presentation is primarily that of a pyogenic liver abscess (sepsis, *Klebsiella* bacteremia). However, the specific finding of a large, solitary left-lobe abscess in a patient from an endemic zone raises the suspicion for ALA. 3. Differential Exclusion: A primary pyogenic liver abscess is the main differential and is supported by the culture results. However, the positive *E. histolytica* serology in a patient with no known history of treated amoebiasis suggests a subclinical amoebic abscess that has become superinfected. Pure ALA is sterile for bacteria; the presence of *Klebsiella* confirms superinfection. 4.

Stool microscopy reveals cysts of a protozoan parasite. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrates hepatomegaly with fatty infiltration and two well-defined hypoechoic lesions in the right hepatic lobe (segments II and VII). What is the most likely diagnosis?",Amoebic Liver Abscess (with concurrent internal hemorrhoids),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young male with a high-risk occupation (driver eating outside food frequently) in a tropical region (India), predisposing him to fecal-oral transmission of *Entamoeba histolytica*. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of fever, right hypochondriac pain/tenderness, and hepatomegaly is the classic triad for liver abscess. The concurrent rectal bleeding and history of incomplete evacuation point toward colonic involvement (amoebic colitis) or, in this specific case, concurrent hemorrhoids which may be exacerbated by the dysentery. 3.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is in a setting (Venezuela) where intestinal parasites are endemic. The co-presentation with COVID-19 is a unique distractor/complicating factor but the geographic risk for amoebiasis remains relevant. 2.

Clinical Anchor: The presentation of a chronic, slowly progressive, painless 'cold abscess' or lymph node mass in the neck is characteristic of scrofula. The lack of acute inflammatory signs (redness, heat) distinguishes it from acute bacterial lymphadenitis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Lymphoma is a strong differential given the size and chronicity, but the granulomatous histology points away from malignancy.

While mediastinal lymphadenitis is more common in children, it can occur in adults, often with an insidious course. The endemicity is implied (study from China). 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is dominated by chronic back pain and mediastinal widening (hilar adenopathy) that mimics musculoskeletal disease or malignancy (like lymphoma). The 'choking sensation' and bronchial erosion seen on CT are critical clues for invasive mediastinal pathology. 3. Differential Exclusion: Lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's) is a major differential for mediastinal adenopathy but is less likely to cause the specific 'bronchial erosion' described or a strongly positive PPD without B-symptoms earlier in the course. Sarcoidosis causes hilar adenopathy but typically is bilateral/symmetric and does not cause caseous necrosis/erosion or positive AFB sputum. 4.

The remainder of the examination, including the genitals and lungs, is unremarkable. A chest X-ray is normal, and HIV serology is negative. Excisional biopsy of the node demonstrates granulomas with multinucleated giant cells and acid-fast bacilli. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Isolated Inguinal Tuberculous Lymphadenitis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young male presenting with chronic lymphadenopathy. While sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common in this age group, the history is negative for high-risk behavior and STI symptoms (ulcers, discharge). The persistence despite antibiotics raises suspicion for atypical pathogens. 2. Clinical Anchor: The key features are the *chronic, painless* nature of the inguinal mass and the presence of *discharging sinuses* (scrofuloderma-like presentation). This constellation, combined with the failure of standard antibiotics, is highly suggestive of mycobacterial infection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV) typically presents with painful buboes and is sexually transmitted; the patient's lack of sexual history and failure to respond to empirical treatment makes this less likely. Syphilis would usually present with a chancre or specific serology. Malignancy (lymphoma) is a consideration but less likely to produce discharging sinuses without significant systemic symptoms or rapid growth. 4.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient presents with constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fatigue) and lymphadenopathy, raising suspicion for malignancy or chronic infection. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is dominated by severe hypercalcemia and renal failure in the presence of granulomatous lymphadenopathy. This constellation mimics sarcoidosis or lymphoma. However, the histology shows *caseating* necrosis (often described as extensive necrosis in the text, distinct from the non-caseating granulomas of sarcoidosis). 3. Differential Exclusion: Multiple Myeloma is excluded by the normal SPEP and bone marrow. Sarcoidosis causes hypercalcemia but typically features non-caseating granulomas; the necrosis seen here points away from it. Lymphoma is a strong consideration but is excluded by the biopsy findings. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by positive TB-PCR from the lymph node tissue, establishing *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* as the etiology of the granulomatous inflammation and the paraneoplastic-like hypercalcemia (mediated by extra-renal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production by activated macrophages).",10,10,5

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a sanitation worker, which increases the risk of exposure to the vector (trombiculid mites/chiggers) found in vegetation/scrub areas. 2. Clinical Anchor: The pathognomonic sign is the **eschar** (a necrotic, cigarette-burn-like lesion) found at the site of the mite bite (in this case, on the neck), combined with the classic progression to Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) including thrombocytopenia, pneumonitis, and renal failure. 3. Differential Exclusion: Septic shock from bacterial cellulitis is a consideration due to the \""skin infection\"" complaint, but the specific finding of an eschar and the systemic vasculitis-like presentation (thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy) points away from staph/strep. Leptospirosis is a differential for fever/renal failure/thrombocytopenia but typically lacks the specific necrotic eschar. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is clinical, supported by the presence of the eschar and the dramatic response to doxycycline (a tetracycline antibiotic), which resolved the MODS and thrombocytopenia where cephalosporins failed.",8,10,5

Clinical Anchor: The combination of fever, altered sensorium (delirium), and specific neurological deficits (facial nerve palsy) alongside hepatosplenomegaly is suggestive. The absence of an eschar does not rule it out (absent in many cases). 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial meningitis is less likely given the lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF.

Serologic testing reveals extremely elevated anti-Plasmodium falciparum IgG titers (index >5,000). A Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay is positive for P. falciparum DNA. Bone marrow biopsy shows no evidence of malignancy. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young male from a malaria-endemic region (Guinea) presenting with massive splenomegaly shortly after arriving in a non-endemic area (Belgium). This fits the classic demographic for HMSS (formerly Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome), which results from an aberrant immune response to chronic malaria exposure. 2. Clinical Anchor: The key clinical anchor is the triad of gross splenomegaly, elevated IgM/polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and high anti-malarial antibody titers in a patient with repeated malaria exposure, despite negative initial blood smears. The specific symptom of \""itching after showering\"" (aquagenic pruritus) is often associated with polycythemia vera but can be seen here due to the hypergammaglobulinemia or underlying sickle trait, though the splenomegaly is the dominant feature. 3. Differential Exclusion: Lymphoma/Leukemia is a major concern given the splenomegaly and B-symptoms (fever, weakness), but is ruled out by the normal bone marrow biopsy and lack of clonal lymphocyte population. Acute Malaria is unlikely given the negative initial smears and chronic course, though the LAMP positive result indicates submicroscopic parasitemia driving the immune response. Visceral Leishmaniasis typically presents with pancytopenia and splenomegaly but serology was negative. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by meeting the revised Fakunle's criteria: persistent splenomegaly, raised anti-malarial antibodies, elevated IgM, exclusion of other causes (like malignancy), and the subsequent positive molecular test (LAMP) proving the presence of the parasite despite low-level parasitemia, followed by clinical resolution upon antimalarial therapy.",10,10,5
352,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12530246/,"A young adult male, originally from Sub-Saharan Africa, presents to the emergency department in Switzerland with fever and nonspecific periumbilical abdominal pain. He reports a history of multiple trips to malaria-endemic regions over the past decade, with the last visit occurring three years ago. He admits to inconsistent use of malaria prophylaxis. Physical examination reveals no palpable abdominal masses, but a review of his medical history notes a prior finding of splenomegaly on imaging one year ago. A new abdominal CT scan confirms worsening splenomegaly, increasing from 11.4 cm to 13.5 cm in length over the last year. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates leukopenia (3.2 g/L), thrombocytopenia (55 g/L), and elevated CRP (111 g/L). A peripheral blood smear detects *Plasmodium falciparum* with low-level parasitemia (<0.1%), and immunofluorescence testing shows significantly elevated anti-plasmodial antibody titers (1:1,280). What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young male from an endemic region (Sub-Saharan Africa) with a history of recurrent exposure to malaria over a decade, which is the requisite trigger for the aberrant immune response. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of massive, progressive splenomegaly, hypersplenism (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), and high titers of anti-malarial antibodies in a patient with low-grade or submicroscopic parasitemia is characteristic of HMSS (formerly Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome). 3. Differential Exclusion: Acute Malaria typically presents with higher parasitemia and acute febrile paroxysms rather than chronic, progressive splenomegaly over years. Lymphoma could cause splenomegaly and B-symptoms but is less likely given the specific serological findings and the context of chronic malaria exposure; bone marrow biopsy would typically be negative for malignancy in HMSS. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is supported by meeting key Fakunle's criteria: gross splenomegaly, hypersplenism, elevated anti-malarial antibodies, and the exclusion of other causes, often confirmed by a clinical response to antimalarial therapy.",4,6,5

Serologies for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and Trypanosoma cruzi are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hyper-reactive Malarial Splenomegaly,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from a malaria-endemic region (Senegal) with a history of recurrent empiric treatments, consistent with chronic antigenic exposure. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark findings are gross splenomegaly (>10 cm) and a dissociation between diagnostic tests: a positive RDT (or serology/PCR) indicating infection, but a consistently negative blood smear due to low-level parasitemia controlled by an exaggerated immune response. 3. Differential Exclusion: Acute malaria typically presents with high fever and positive blood smears; the patient's afebrile status (hypothermia likely due to environmental exposure) and negative smear argue against this. Visceral Leishmaniasis and Schistosomiasis can cause massive splenomegaly but are less likely given the specific combination of positive malaria antigen/serology and negative smear in a patient from this specific demographic without other stigmata (e.g., portal hypertension for Schiso). Lymphoma is possible but less likely given the improvement with antimalarials often seen in these cases (response to therapy is a diagnostic criterion). 4.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from Papua New Guinea, a region highly endemic for malaria, and has a history of massive splenomegaly since childhood. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of massive splenomegaly (>20cm), hypersplenism (pancytopenia), and high titers of anti-malarial antibodies (implied by the diagnosis, though not tested in this specific acute presentation due to availability) in a patient from an endemic area is characteristic of HMSS (formerly Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome). The history of splenectomy/gastrectomy at a young age for variceal bleeding supports long-standing portal hypertension driven by the splenomegaly. 3. Differential Exclusion: Cirrhosis is unlikely given the absence of primary liver disease stigmata (e.g., ascites, specific liver enzyme patterns associated with hepatitis) and the specific vascular findings (sinistral hypertension). Hematological malignancies like CML or lymphoma can cause massive splenomegaly but were ruled out by bone marrow biopsy. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is established by the clinical criteria (Fakunle's criteria) including gross splenomegaly, hypersplenism, and epidemiological context, leading to the decision for partial splenectomy to manage the complications while preserving some immune function against future malaria infection.",3,3,5

What is the most likely pathogen responsible for this bacteremia?",Non-typhoidal Salmonella (Salmonella species),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is an elderly, critically ill male with significant comorbidities (diabetes, renal failure, cancer history), placing him at high risk for invasive disease from gastrointestinal pathogens. 2. Clinical Anchor: The development of fever, diarrhea, and rapid-growth gram-negative bacteremia in a patient who has been hospitalized and NPO for over two weeks is highly unusual for this specific pathogen. While *E. coli* or *Klebsiella* are common, the specific scenario of an \""isolated\"" case of a typically foodborne/zoonotic pathogen in a closed environment suggests a rare nosocomial transmission or reactivation of latent infection. 3. Differential Exclusion: *Clostridioides difficile* is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea but does not cause bacteremia. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* causes nosocomial bacteremia but is not typically associated with the specific \""foodborne\"" profile implied by the exclusion of travel/reptiles in the vignette's context clues. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the isolation of *Salmonella* species from the blood.

Physical examination is notable for marked pallor and severe point tenderness over the thoracic spine, though neurological function remains intact. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates severe anemia (Hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL), leukocytosis (21.6 × 10⁹/L), and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 138 mg/L). Computed tomography reveals destruction of the T5 vertebral body, a large paraspinal soft tissue collection, and bilateral pulmonary consolidations.

Clinical Anchor: The presentation of osteomyelitis (specifically vertebral spondylodiscitis) in a patient with Sickle Cell Disease is a classic medical board association. While Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of osteomyelitis overall, the presence of multi-focal infection (pneumonia + bone) in this specific demographic strongly points toward Salmonella. 3. Differential Exclusion: Staphylococcus aureus is the main competitor and is statistically the most common cause of osteomyelitis even in sickle cell patients; however, in the context of a board question emphasizing the unique risk factors of SCD, Salmonella is the intended high-yield answer. Tuberculosis (Pott's disease) is a consideration for vertebral destruction but typically presents more chronically and without the acute bacterial pneumonia picture. 4.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient presents with a febrile illness clinically mimicking Enteric (Typhoid) Fever, common in pediatric populations. However, the lack of response to ceftriaxone suggests a resistant organism or an alternative pathology. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from a febrile illness to a state of hyperinflammation defined by the 'HLH pentad' (fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow) serves as the clinical anchor. The isolation of non-lactose fermenting Gram-negative bacilli points to Salmonella. 3. Differential Exclusion: Enteric Fever (Salmonella Typhi) is the primary distractor; however, S. Typhi is less likely to cause this degree of rapid clinical deterioration into HLH compared to invasive Non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) in this specific resistant context. Additionally, the organism is identified as Non-typhoidal (specifically S. Enteritidis in this case report) which is distinct from S. Typhi. 4.

Clinical Anchor: The presentation of fever and severe deep gluteal pain reproduced by stretching the piriformis muscle (suggesting piriformis syndrome) combined with MRI findings of muscle inflammation anchors the diagnosis of pyomyositis. The key microbiological clue is the isolation of Gram-negative bacilli from the blood and a matching positive stool culture, strongly implicating an enteric pathogen despite the lack of diarrheal symptoms. 3. Differential Exclusion: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of pyomyositis (up to 90% of cases) but would present as Gram-positive cocci. Lumbar radiculopathy (sciatica) is a structural differential for buttock pain but is excluded by the presence of high fever, inflammatory markers, and intramedullary muscle signal change on MRI. 4.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Spinal Cystic Echinococcosis (Hydatid Disease),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from South Africa, a region where Echinococcus is endemic. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is chronic back pain with an expansile, *multicystic* lesion destroying a vertebra (L4). This is a classic radiological appearance for spinal hydatidosis ('water-lily sign' or multicystic destruction), although differential diagnoses like aneurysmal bone cyst or metastases exist. 3. Differential Exclusion: Tuberculosis (Pott's disease) typically involves the disc space (diskitis) and adjacent vertebrae, often with an abscess, whereas this lesion is primarily vertebral body destruction with distinct *cysts*. Malignancy (metastasis/plasmacytoma) would likely present with lytic lesions but not the specific *cystic* morphology with laminated walls seen on biopsy. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is definitively confirmed by the histopathological findings of a laminated PAS-positive wall, daughter cysts, and protoscolices with refractile hooklets, which are pathognomonic for *Echinococcus granulosus* infection.",8,10,5
367,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38093379/,"A 30-year-old male from Tunisia presents with a 4-month history of hypogastric pain. He denies fever, weight loss, or changes in bowel or bladder habits. On physical examination, a 10-cm, hard, tender hypogastric mass is palpable. Routine laboratory tests, including white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, are within normal limits. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis reveals a 13 × 17 cm well-defined cystic mass in the pouch of Douglas with homogeneous liquid content and a slightly enhancing wall. The mass displaces the bladder anteriorly and the rectum posteriorly but does not communicate with the digestive tract. Notably, there are no cystic lesions in the liver or lungs. Intraoperatively, the cyst is whitish and adheres to the bladder. Aspiration confirms the diagnosis, and the cyst is treated surgically. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Primary Peritoneal Cystic Echinococcosis (Hydatid Cyst),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from Tunisia, a region highly endemic for *Echinococcus granulosus* (hydatid disease). 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation is a large, isolated peritoneal cyst in the pouch of Douglas causing mass effect (pain) without systemic signs of infection (normal WBC/CRP). 3. Differential Exclusion: While cystic lymphangioma or ileal duplication cysts are differentials for peritoneal cysts, the endemic origin strongly favors echinococcosis. The absence of liver or lung involvement characterizes this as 'primary' peritoneal disease, which is rare (<2% of cases). Malignancy is less likely given the well-defined, cystic nature and lack of constitutional symptoms. 4. Confirmation: Diagnosis is confirmed intraoperatively by the macroscopic appearance (whitish cyst), successful aspiration (though risks exist, it was done here), and histopathology showing the germinal layer consistent with *Echinococcus*. The treatment (PAIR-like approach intraop or excision) and albendazole follow-up align with this diagnosis.",10,10,5

Originally from Macedonia and having lived in Turkey, she moved to France 5 years ago. She denies animal exposure. On initial presentation, she is afebrile, but auscultation reveals reduced breath sounds in the right upper lobe. A chest X-ray and CT scan demonstrate a large, well-defined thoracic cyst with smooth borders and no calcification; abdominal imaging is normal. While awaiting scheduled surgery, she returns 3 weeks later with sudden worsening chest pain, cough, and fever. Laboratory evaluation now reveals leukocytosis with significant eosinophilia (3,270/mm³) and elevated CRP (226 mg/L). Repeat imaging shows air-fluid levels and the appearance of a floating membrane within the cyst ('water lily sign'). What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pulmonary Cystic Echinococcosis (Hydatid Cyst),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient originates from endemic regions (Macedonia/Turkey), which is a key risk factor for Echinococcus granulosus infection, even without recalled animal exposure. 2. Clinical Anchor: The initial presentation is a silent, growing mass. The critical anchor is the acute decompensation (rupture) leading to fever, hypersensitivity (eosinophilia), and the classic radiological sign of the 'germinative membrane' detaching (often described as the water lily sign) after the cyst ruptures into the bronchus. 3. Differential Exclusion: Pulmonary abscess would present with fever earlier and typically has thick, irregular walls, not the smooth cystic appearance initially seen. Tuberculosis usually involves cavitary lesions or consolidation, not a large, well-defined cyst that subsequently ruptures. Malignancy is less likely in a young patient with such a rapid evolution of cyst morphology and marked eosinophilia. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by positive Western Blot serology (bands p7 and p26) and definitively by pathology showing protoscoleces and rostellar hooks .",10,10,5

Two weeks prior to presentation, he developed acute right hemiparesis. On admission, fundoscopic examination reveals papilledema (signs of intracranial hypertension). A non-contrast CT scan shows a large hypodense left fronto-parietal lesion with significant mass effect but no perilesional edema. MRI confirms a 7 x 7.5 x 6 cm unilocular cystic lesion with cerebrospinal fluid-like signal intensity, no contrast enhancement, and no surrounding edema. Abdominal ultrasound and chest X-ray are unremarkable for other cysts. The patient undergoes surgery for removal of the cyst. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Primary Cerebral Cystic Echinococcosis (Hydatid Cyst),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a child living in a rural area (Roman countryside) on a family farm, which implies potential exposure to livestock (sheep) and dogs, the definitive hosts for *Echinococcus*. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of signs of raised intracranial pressure (headache, papilledema) and focal deficit (hemiparesis) due to a large, *unilocular* cystic lesion with *no perilesional edema* and *no contrast enhancement* is highly characteristic of a cerebral hydatid cyst. The lack of edema distinguishes it from abscesses or high-grade tumors. 3. Differential Exclusion: Neurocysticercosis usually presents with multiple small cysts, often with calcifications or edema/enhancement (ring-enhancing lesions), not a single giant unilocular cyst without edema. Arachnoid cysts are extra-axial, whereas this lesion causes significant mass effect and is intracerebral (though displacing parenchyma). Cystic astrocytomas would typically show contrast enhancement (mural nodule). 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the specific imaging characteristics (large, spherical, non-enhancing, no edema) and definitive identification of the G3 genotype of *Echinococcus granulosus* sensu stricto from the cyst fluid/wall after surgical removal.",10,10,5
370,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38921947/,"An 18-year-old female from a rural area presents to the emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain and significant distension. Physical examination reveals a palpable mass extending from the epigastrium to the right hypochondrium.

An abdominal CT scan reveals massive hepatomegaly with at least 11 cystic lesions of varying sizes occupying both lobes. The cysts exhibit diverse morphologies: some appear multivesicular with a honeycomb pattern, while others show detached, floating membranes within the fluid. A solitary 3 cm cystic lesion is also noted in the right lower lobe of the lung. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Disseminated Cystic Echinococcosis (Hydatid Disease),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient resides in a rural area, a significant risk factor for zoonotic transmission of Echinococcus granulosus via the dog-sheep cycle. 2. Clinical Anchor: The hallmark finding is the presence of multiple hepatic cysts with pathognomonic radiological features: the 'honeycomb' pattern indicating multivesicular daughter cysts (WHO CE2) and the 'water-lily sign' indicating detached endocyst membranes (WHO CE3a). 3. Differential Exclusion: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Liver Disease presents with multiple cysts but lacks the complex internal architecture (daughter cysts/membranes) and typically does not cause significant inflammation (elevated CRP/fibrinogen). Pyogenic liver abscesses are usually distinct from the well-defined, multiloculated cysts seen here and do not typically present with lung cysts unless there is septic embolization, which would cause more severe systemic toxicity. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the characteristic imaging findings of hydatid cysts in both the liver and lung, supported by the patient's rural background and inflammatory markers indicative of complicated disease.",10,10,5

Six days into the illness, a diffuse rash appeared on her trunk. On physical examination, she is afebrile (36.3°C) but appears distressed. There is palpable, tender left inguinal lymphadenopathy. A necrotic eschar with a surrounding erythematous halo is noted on the inner right thigh. A generalized macular edematous erythematous rash is present on the trunk, face, and lower extremities. Laboratory evaluation reveals a mildly elevated C-reactive protein (3.03 mg/dL) with normal complete blood count and liver enzymes.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a recent travel history to an endemic region (South Africa) and engaged in high-risk outdoor activities (wildlife volunteering, game reserves), exposing her to *Amblyomma* ticks, the vector for *Rickettsia africae*. \n2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical presentation is characterized by the classic triad of fever, regional lymphadenopathy, and an inoculation eschar (tache noire). The presence of an eschar in a returning traveler from Southern Africa is highly suggestive of a rickettsial infection. \n3. Differential Exclusion: Malaria is a primary consideration in febrile travelers but does not cause eschars or this type of rash. Typhoid fever may present with a rash (rose spots) but lacks the eschar and lymphadenopathy. Mediterranean Spotted Fever (*Rickettsia conorii*) is a differential, but it is typically more severe, associated with dogs in urban/peri-urban settings, and less likely to present with the multiple eschars often seen in *R. africae* (though this patient had a single one, the specific rural/game park exposure favors *R. africae*). \n4.

Bacterial blood cultures are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",African Tick Bite Fever (Rickettsia africae),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient traveled to a rural endemic area in Southern Africa. While investigating mosquitoes, he was also exposed to the habitat of *Amblyomma* ticks. 2. Clinical Anchor: The key features are the flu-like illness (fever, myalgia), regional lymphadenopathy, and the presence of an eschar. A specific clue often pointing to *R. africae* over other rickettsial species is the patient's report of *multiple* eschars (aggressive *Amblyomma* ticks often attack in groups), even though only one remained active at presentation. 3.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Disseminated Histoplasmosis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV/AIDS (CD4 <20), which is the primary risk factor for disseminated fungal infection. The geographic setting (Central California) strongly suggests *Coccidioides* (Valley Fever), but his origin (Mexico) allows for the reactivation of latent *Histoplasma capsulatum* acquired years prior. 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical triad of pancytopenia (bone marrow infiltration), transaminitis (granulomatous hepatitis), and diffuse pulmonary nodules in an AIDS patient is highly suggestive of disseminated histoplasmosis.

Epidemiology/Risk: The patient lives in the Midwestern United States (a known endemic region for *Histoplasma capsulatum*). Although he is immunocompetent, massive inoculation or specific genetic susceptibility can lead to dissemination. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) characterized by hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, and *bilateral* adrenal enlargement is a classic extrapulmonary manifestation of disseminated histoplasmosis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Tuberculosis is a primary differential for bilateral adrenal enlargement, especially in a patient from South Asia, but is less likely given the specific fungal morphology found on biopsy.

Microscopic examination of the urine sediment reveals the presence of terminal-spined trematode eggs . What is the most likely diagnosis?,Urogenital Schistosomiasis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a fisherman with frequent freshwater contact in a region (Nepal/India border) where sporadic, likely zoonotic, cases of trematode infection have been reported, despite it not being classically endemic for human schistosomiasis. 2. Clinical Anchor: The presentation of hematuria (micro- or macroscopic) combined with peripheral eosinophilia and bladder wall thickening is the classic triad for urogenital schistosomiasis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Urothelial carcinoma is a differential for bladder thickening and hematuria but is less likely in a 34-year-old and is ruled out by the identification of parasites. Urinary tuberculosis could cause wall thickening but typically presents with sterile pyuria and would not demonstrate trematode eggs. 4. Confirmation: The definitive diagnosis is made by the microscopic visualization of characteristic terminal-spined eggs (morphologically resembling *Schistosoma haematobium*) in the urine sediment.",10,10,5
402,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33936604/,"A 32-year-old woman from Harare, Zimbabwe, presents with a 4-day history of severe acute-on-chronic pelvic pain and inability to walk upright due to pain. She reports a 10-month history of chronic pelvic pain and intermittent dysuria starting during a pregnancy that was complicated by preterm prelabor rupture of membranes and delivery at 32 weeks. She has been treated with multiple courses of antibiotics for presumed urinary tract infections and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) without resolution. She denies recent travel to rural areas or swimming in unprotected water sources. Physical examination reveals lower abdominal guarding, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. Routine urine microscopy is negative for ova. An initial diagnosis of severe PID is treated with IV antibiotics for 48 hours with no improvement. Diagnostic laparoscopy reveals omental adhesions but normal reproductive organs. However, cystoscopy identifies a \""sandy\"" mass on the right lateral bladder wall . A biopsy of this lesion is performed. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Urogenital Schistosomiasis,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: Although the patient lives in an urban area and denies water contact, she resides in an endemic country (Zimbabwe). Chronic pelvic pain and history of adverse pregnancy outcomes (PPROM) in this region should raise suspicion for endemic infections. 2. Clinical Anchor: The persistence of \""PID-like\"" symptoms despite antibiotic therapy and the cystoscopic finding of a \""sandy mass\"" (sandy patches are pathognomonic) are key clues. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial PID and chronic cystitis are excluded by the lack of response to standard antibiotics and the specific cystoscopic findings. Malignancy (e.g., bladder cancer) is a differential for a bladder mass but is less likely given the specific \""sandy\"" morphology and patient demographics. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the histological identification of *Schistosoma* eggs in the bladder biopsy, despite negative urine microscopy.",10,10,5
403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26540295/,"A 45-year-old male living in Spain presents with intermittent dysuria, back pain, and visible hematuria. He reports a history of discontinuous hematuria since childhood, which originated during his upbringing in the Dominican Republic, where he frequently bathed in a local river until 1984. He has no history of travel to Africa or the Middle East. Physical examination is unremarkable. Urinalysis confirms hematuria (4-10 RBCs/μL). Standard workup for sexually transmitted infections, urinary tuberculosis, and urolithiasis is negative. An abdominal ultrasound is normal, but cystoscopy reveals two 2mm exophytic lesions in the bladder fundus. Biopsy of these lesions is inconclusive. However, microscopic examination of the urine sediment reveals viable trematode eggs with a terminal spine . Serology is positive (1:80). PCR of the urine is positive for the specific complex but negative for *Schistosoma mansoni*. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Urogenital Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium complex),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a history of childhood freshwater exposure in the Dominican Republic. While urogenital schistosomiasis is typically endemic to Africa and the Middle East, the clinical picture and findings strongly point to this diagnosis, suggesting a rare or zoonotic transmission event (possibly involving *S. bovis* hybrids) or an unmapped endemic focus. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of chronic hematuria, dysuria, and the specific microscopic finding of terminal-spined eggs in the urine is pathognomonic for urogenital schistosomiasis. 3. Differential Exclusion: Urolithiasis and sexually transmitted infections were ruled out. Bladder malignancy is a consideration given the exophytic lesions, but the biopsy did not show cancer, and the presence of parasite eggs confirms the infectious etiology. *S. mansoni* typically causes intestinal disease and has lateral-spined eggs, which were not seen here. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the visualization of terminal-spined eggs (morphologically *S. haematobium* group) and positive PCR for the *S. haematobium* complex.",10,10,5
404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35232737/,"A man in his early 20s presents for evaluation after routine blood testing reveals profound renal impairment (creatinine 1122 µmol/L, eGFR 5 mL/min/1.73 m²). He migrated from north-central Africa to Europe one year ago. He denies gross hematuria but reports dysuria and mild, generalized abdominal pain. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show no peripheral eosinophilia. Renal ultrasound demonstrates severe bilateral hydronephrosis and significant cortical thinning. A non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis reveals severe bilateral ureterohydronephrosis, renal parenchymal thinning, and peripheral calcifications along the renal margins and ureters. The urinary bladder is irregular in shape with diffuse, thick calcification of the walls. Cystoscopy shows a thickened bladder wall with granulomatous lesions. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Urinary Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young male from an endemic region (north-central Africa) presenting with chronic urinary tract pathology. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of obstructive uropathy (bilateral hydronephrosis) and specific radiological findings—calcified bladder walls and ureters—is highly characteristic of chronic infection with *Schistosoma haematobium*. 3. Differential Exclusion: Tuberculosis can cause ureteral strictures and calcifications but typically causes a 'thimble bladder' rather than diffuse wall thickening with such extensive calcification, and granulomas would be caseating. Urothelial carcinoma is less likely given the patient's age and diffuse calcifications. 4. Confirmation: Diagnosis is confirmed by the cystoscopic identification of sandy patches/granulomas and the histological finding of calcified *Schistosoma haematobium* eggs  in the bladder biopsy.",10,10,5
405,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36013468/,"A 20-year-old female, who recently immigrated from Ethiopia, presents to the emergency department with a one-day history of right flank pain and lower abdominal discomfort coincident with the onset of menses. She denies any history of premenstrual hematuria or prior urologic issues. Physical examination reveals tenderness at the right costovertebral angle, but the abdomen is soft. Urinalysis shows microscopic hematuria and pyuria but no bacteria or malignant cells. Complete blood count is notable for a mild eosinophilia of 18%. A CT scan of the abdomen identifies a 1.5 cm pedunculated intraluminal mass on the right anterior superior wall of the urinary bladder. Cystoscopy with transurethral resection is performed to rule out malignancy. Histopathological examination of the resected mass reveals numerous elongated ova with terminal spines surrounded by eosinophils. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Urinary Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is a young immigrant from an endemic region (Ethiopia/sub-Saharan Africa), raising the pre-test probability for parasitic infections. 2. Clinical Anchor: The combination of a bladder mass (mimicking a neoplasm) in a young patient, peripheral eosinophilia, and the specific histological finding of eggs with terminal spines is pathognomonic. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bladder carcinoma (e.g., transitional cell or squamous cell) is a consideration given the mass, but the patient's young age makes it less likely, and the biopsy shows parasitic eggs rather than malignant cells. Urinary tuberculosis typically presents with sterile pyuria and scarring, not a pedunculated mass with eggs. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of *Schistosoma haematobium* eggs (characterized by their terminal spine) within the bladder tissue granuloma.",10,10,5
406,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37719554/,"A 23-year-old gravida 5, para 0 Honduran female at 33 weeks gestation presents with persistent vomiting, tachycardia, and a syncopal episode. Earlier in the week, she was admitted for similar symptoms, diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori gastritis via EGD, and received a course of antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity before discharge. On current readmission, she develops vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain, prompting an emergent cesarean section for placental abruption. Post-operatively, she deteriorates with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis. A CT pulmonary angiogram reveals ground-glass nodules initially suspected to be hypersensitivity pneumonitis , but there is no pulmonary embolism. Abdominal imaging shows small bowel thickening suggesting enterocolitis. Blood cultures grow coagulase-negative Staph and E. coli. Sputum cytology and stool studies eventually reveal the diagnosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from an endemic region (Honduras). The critical risk factor is the administration of antenatal corticosteroids, which suppresses eosinophilia and cell-mediated immunity, allowing the parasite to proliferate unchecked. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, gastritis mimic) to respiratory failure (ground-glass opacities representing larval migration/hemorrhage) and sepsis (translocation of gut flora like E. coli) following steroid exposure is the classic presentation of Strongyloides hyperinfection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis does not explain the sepsis or abdominal findings. Aspiration pneumonia is possible but would not typically present with the specific constellation of gram-negative sepsis and diffuse ground-glass nodules in this timeline. Placental abruption here is likely secondary to the systemic inflammatory response or direct parasitic effect. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of *Strongyloides stercoralis* larvae in the stool and, crucially, in the sputum , indicating dissemination outside the GI tract.",10,10,5
407,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36137646/,"A 70-year-old male originally from Southeast Asia presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, distension, and high fever. His recent medical history is significant for two hospital admissions in the last two months: the first for a febrile illness with cough and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates treated as pneumonia, and the second for new-onset generalized seizures attributed to a small cerebral hypodensity. Review of laboratory trends reveals a significant peripheral eosinophilia (2.46 × 10^9/L) during the initial respiratory presentation, but current blood work shows a precipitous drop in eosinophils to near-undetectable levels (0.05 × 10^9/L). Within 24 hours of admission, he develops nuchal rigidity and obtundation. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals a neutrophilic pleocytosis with elevated protein and low glucose, but bacterial cultures are negative. Stool microscopy is performed. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome (with CNS involvement),"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from Southeast Asia, an endemic region for *Strongyloides stercoralis*, where chronic autoinfection can persist for decades . 2. Clinical Anchor: The clinical course follows the classic migration path of the parasite during hyperinfection: pulmonary symptoms (larval migration through lungs), gastrointestinal obstruction/ileus, and finally CNS invasion (meningitis/abscess). A critical prognostic sign is the \""vanishing eosinophilia\""—the drop from high to low eosinophil counts typically heralds the transition to overwhelming hyperinfection and is a poor prognostic marker. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial meningitis is a major consideration, often caused by gut flora (e.g., *E. coli*) carried by the larvae (enteric bacteremia), but the underlying driver is the parasite. Tuberculosis can cause chronic meningitis but does not typically present with this specific sequence of eosinophilic pneumonitis followed by an eosinopenic crash. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of rhabditiform larvae in the stool  or parasite DNA in the CSF.",10,10,5
408,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33133837/,"A 55-year-old Asian American male presents with worsening epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a 30-pound weight loss over three months. His past medical history is significant for small intestinal lymphoma (currently in remission after resection and chemotherapy) and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), for which he was started on high-dose prednisone (1 mg/kg) a few months ago. He initially reported no significant travel history. Physical examination reveals mild epigastric tenderness. Initial laboratory workup shows mild normocytic anemia and leukocytosis with neutrophilia; notably, he had a peripheral eosinophilia of 12% prior to starting steroids, which has now resolved. Abdominal CT and retroperitoneal ultrasound are unremarkable. Despite acid suppression therapy, his symptoms progress to melena. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) reveals severe erosive gastritis and duodenitis with diffuse ulceration. Biopsies of the gastric and duodenal mucosa demonstrate a heavy burden of parasitic organisms within the crypts . Upon further questioning, he discloses travel to Cambodia two years prior. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has a critical risk factor: initiation of high-dose corticosteroids for renal disease. Steroids are a potent trigger for the transformation of chronic, asymptomatic *Strongyloides* infection into hyperinfection syndrome by suppressing eosinophilia and T-cell immunity. He also has a relevant travel history to an endemic region (Cambodia), albeit remote. 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from chronic, vague abdominal symptoms to severe erosive gastroduodenitis and melena following immunosuppression is characteristic. The \""vanishing eosinophilia\"" (presence of eosinophilia before steroids, absence during acute deterioration) is a classic and ominous sign of hyperinfection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Intestinal lymphoma recurrence is a valid concern given his history, but the biopsy showed parasites, not malignant cells. *Helicobacter pylori* or NSAID-induced gastritis would not present with such profound weight loss and parasitic forms on biopsy. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is definitively confirmed by the histological visualization of numerous *Strongyloides stercoralis* larvae and eggs within the gastric and duodenal mucosa.",10,10,5
409,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32463606/,"A 40-year-old male with a history of homelessness, chronic alcoholism, and diabetes mellitus presents with a 2-week history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and a 10 kg weight loss. He is originally from Oaxaca, Mexico. Physical examination reveals tachycardia, dehydration, and a distended, tender abdomen with diminished bowel sounds. Initial laboratory studies show leukocytosis (16,200/µL) with 92.3% neutrophils and minimal eosinophils (0.66%). He has hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Abdominal X-ray suggests paralytic ileus. Despite nasogastric decompression and fluids, the ileus persists, and he undergoes laparotomy. Post-operatively, he develops dyspnea, hemoptysis, and fever. Chest X-ray demonstrates bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Bronchoscopy is performed due to clinical deterioration. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient is from an endemic region (Oaxaca, Mexico) and has multiple risk factors for hyperinfection: alcoholism (altered cortisol metabolism/intestinal motility) and diabetes mellitus (immune dysfunction). 2. Clinical Anchor: The progression from gastrointestinal symptoms (ileus, weight loss) to severe pulmonary symptoms (hemoptysis, diffuse infiltrates) is the classic 'autoinfection' cycle accelerating into hyperinfection. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial sepsis/pneumonia is a consideration, but the specific sequence of paralytic ileus followed by hemorrhagic pneumonitis in a high-risk host points towards parasitic dissemination. The absence of eosinophilia is a poor prognostic sign typical of severe hyperinfection, distinguishing it from simple chronic strongyloidiasis where eosinophilia is common. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of *Strongyloides stercoralis* filariform larvae in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  and rhabditiform larvae in the stool.",8,10,5

On arrival, he is febrile (38.3°C), hypertensive, and responds only to pain. Physical examination reveals a diffuse maculopapular rash and cachexia. Initial laboratory evaluation shows leukocytosis (29.4% eosinophils), severe hyperglycemia (HbA1c 8.5%), and a positive HIV-1 RNA (98,333 copies/mL) with a CD4 count of 25. A lumbar puncture performed for altered mental status and meningeal signs yields purulent CSF with neutrophilic pleocytosis (144,218/mm³), low glucose (50 mg/dL), and high protein (>600 mg/dL), but Gram stain and culture are negative. A chest CT demonstrates a left lower lobe opacity and multiple pulmonary nodules. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed to investigate the pulmonary infiltrates. Microscopic examination of the BAL fluid reveals motile larvae . What is the most likely diagnosis?",Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome,"1. Epidemiology/Risk: The patient has advanced HIV/AIDS (CD4 count 25), a major risk factor for opportunistic infections and hyperinfection syndrome. 2. Clinical Anchor: The triad of gram-negative sepsis/meningitis (implied by purulent CSF with negative cultures, often due to enteric bacteria carried by larvae), pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates/nodules), and a diffuse rash (larva currens or petechiae) in an immunocompromised host is highly suggestive of disseminated Strongyloidiasis. The high peripheral eosinophilia (29.4%) is a key clue, though eosinophilia can be absent in severe cases. 3. Differential Exclusion: Bacterial meningitis is the primary differential for the CSF findings, but the negative cultures and the presence of pulmonary nodules point to a systemic process. Cryptococcus and Tuberculosis are considerations in AIDS but do not typically present with significant eosinophilia or motile larvae in the lungs. 4. Confirmation: The diagnosis is definitively established by the visualization of *Strongyloides stercoralis* filariform larvae in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, confirming extra-intestinal dissemination.",10,10,5
